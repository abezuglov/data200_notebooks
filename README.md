# DATA 200: Introduction to Data Analytics

This repository contains python notebooks for Data Science classes. It has previously contained notebooks in support of Introduction to Data Analytics class at Buena Vista University only. It now includes material that was not a part of the original class.  

Below is a brief summary of the notebooks:

* 01 -- 03 -- NumPy vs. Python, vectorized computation, slicing, etc.
* 04 -- Obtaining data via web scraping with examples
* 05 -- Working with API's: US Census, Twitter, Foursquare
* 06 -- Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and Feature Extraction
* 07 -- Dealing with Unstructured Data: Bag of words, Count vectorizer, and TF.IDF vectorizer
* 08 -- Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering with examples
* 09 -- Unsupervised learning: Principal Component Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction
* 0x -- Techniques for data visualization
* 10 -- Supervised learning: Linear and Logistic Regressions, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation
* 11 -- TensorFlow: Intro and regressions examples
* 12 -- Supervised learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, TensorFlow
* 13 -- Case Study: Building a spam filter with TfidfVectorizer, PCA, LogisticRegression/ANN
* 14 -- Transfer learning with Keras models
* 15 -- Linear regression: Statistical Perspective
