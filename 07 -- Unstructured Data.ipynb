       "'Heilsbronn Abbey was a Cistercian monastery at Heilsbronn in the district of Ansbach in Middle Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. It was part of the Diocese of Eichstätt. It was founded in 1132–33 by Saint Otto of Bamberg and was settled by monks from Ebrach Abbey, under the first abbot Rapotho. It was one of the wealthiest monasteries of Germany, with possessions around Franconia as far as Regensburg and in Württemberg. These rich endowments were mostly made by the dukes of Abenberg and their heirs, the Hohenzollern Burgraves of Nuremberg. It was the hereditary burial-place of the Hohenzollern family and ten burgraves of Nuremberg, five margraves and three electors of Brandenburg, besides many other persons of note, were buried here. Heilsbronn was a flourishing monastery until the time of the Reformation. In 1530 Abbot John Schopper (1529–1540) founded a monastic school here, which later became a Protestant school for princes, and the doctrines of Luther gradually found favour in the monastery. His successor, Sebastian Wagner, openly supported Protestantism. He married and resigned in 1543. In 1549 Roman Catholicism was restored at Heilsbronn, but only ostensibly, and the abbey seems to have ceased to be a Catholic house in 1555, although it existed for some years longer. The last abbot who made any pretense to Catholic belief was Melchior Wunderer (1562–1578). The five succeeding abbots were Protestants, and in 1631 Heilsbronn ceased to be an abbey. Its valuable library was transferred to Erlangen. The buildings of the monastery have mostly disappeared, with the exception of the fine church, known as Münster Heilsbronn, a Romanesque basilica, restored between 1851 and 1866, and possessing paintings by Albrecht Dürer. The Monk of Heilsbronn was a didactic poet of the 14th century, author of the works Sieben Graden, Tochter Syon and Leben des heiligen Alexius.

Then an army from al-Madinah of the best people on the earth at that time will leave for them. When they line up in ranks, the Romans will say, Leave us and those who were taken as prisoners from amongst us so we can fight them.\\u2019 The Muslims will say, Nay, by Allah, we will not abandon our brothers to you.\\u2019 So they will fight them. Then one third of them will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third will be killed; they will be the best martyrs with Allah. And one third will conquer them; they will never be afflicted with fitnah. Then they will conquer Constantinople.

When they arrive to Sham he comes out. Then while they are preparing for battle and filing their ranks, the prayer is called. So Isa Ibn Maryam (alayhis-Salam) will descend and lead them.

Raise your head high, for today \\u2013 by Allah\\u2019s grace \\u2013 you have a state and Khilafah, which will return your dignity, might, rights, and leadership. It is a state where the Arab and non-Arab, the white man and black man, the easterner and westerner are all brothers. It is a Khilafah that gathered the Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Shami, Iraqi, Yemeni, Egyptian, Maghribi (North African), American, French, German, and Australian. Allah brought their hearts together, and thus, they became brothers by His grace, loving each other for the sake of Allah, standing in a single trench, defending and guarding each other, and sacrificing themselves for one another. Their blood mixed and became one, under a single flag and goal, in one pavilion, enjoying this blessing, the blessing of faithful brotherhood. If kings were to taste this blessing, they would abandon their kingdoms and fight over this grace. So all praise and thanks are due to Allah. Soon, by Allah\\u2019s permission, a day will come when the Muslim will walk everywhere as a master, having honor, being revered, with his head raised high and his dignity preserved. Anyone who dares to offend him will be disciplined, and any hand that reaches out to harm him will be cut off. So let the world know that we are living today in a new era. Whoever was heedless must now be alert. Whoever was sleeping must now awaken. Whoever was shocked and amazed must comprehend. The Muslims today have a loud, thundering statement, and possess heavy boots. They have a statement to make that will cause the world to hear and understand the meaning of terrorism, and boots that will trample the idol of nationalism, destroy the idol of democracy, and uncover its deviant nature. The time has come for those generations that were drowning in oceans of disgrace, being nursed on the milk of humiliation, and being ruled by the vilest of all people, after their long slumber in the darkness of neglect \\u2013 the time has come for them to rise. The time has come for the Ummah of Muhammad (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) to wake up from its sleep, remove the garments of dishonor, and shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace, for the era of lamenting and moaning has gone, and the dawn of honor has emerged anew. The sun of jihad has risen. The glad tidings of good are shining. Triumph looms on the horizon. The signs of victory have appeared.\",\"O Ummah of Islam, indeed the world today has been divided into two camps and two trenches, with no third camp present: The camp of Islam and faith, and the camp of kufr (disbelief) and hypocrisy \\u2013 the camp of the Muslims and the mujahidin everywhere, and the camp of the jews, the crusaders, their allies, and with them the rest of the nations and religions of kufr, all being led by America and Russia, and being mobilized by the jews.\",\"Therefore, rush O Muslims to your state. Yes, it is your state. Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians, and Iraq is not for the Iraqis. The earth is Allah\\u2019s. {Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous} [Al-A\\u2019raf: 128]. The State is a state for all Muslims. The land is for the Muslims, all the Muslims. O Muslims everywhere, whoever is capable of performing hijrah (emigration) to the Islamic State, then let him do so, because hijrah to the land of Islam is obligatory.\",\"We make a special call to the scholars, fuqaha\\u2019 (experts in Islamic jurisprudence), and callers, especially the judges, as well as people with military, administrative, and service expertise, and medical doctors and engineers of all different specializations and fields. We call them and remind them to fear Allah, for their emigration is wajib ayni (an individual obligation), so that they can answer the dire need of the Muslims for them. People are ignorant of their religion and they thirst for those who can teach them and help them understand it. So fear Allah, O slaves of Allah.\",\"Abdullah Ibn Amr narrated that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, Indeed a man\\u2019s iman (faith) becomes worn out within him just as a garment becomes worn out, so ask Allah to renew the iman in your heart.\",\"{And do not be like the one who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has become strong, by taking your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves when one group is more numerous than another group. Allah tests you by this. And on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly clarify that which you differed over.} [AnNahl: 94]\",\"In explaining this verse, the scholars of tafsir stated, This was a foolish woman in Makkah. Every time she spun some thread and made it strong, she would undo it again.\",\"Abdullah Ibn Umar (radiyallahu anhuma) narrated that the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, Indeed every man is a shepherd and every shepherd is responsible for his flock. So the imam of the people is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock.\",\"In a part of the hadith of Hudhayfah (radiyallahu anh), the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) said, Stick to the jama\\u2019ah (congregation) of the Muslims and their imam. I said, And if they have neither a jama\\u2019ah nor an imam? He said, Then avoid every group, even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree until death reaches you while you\\u2019re in that condition. [Reported by AlBukhari and Muslim]\",\"Qays Ibn Hazim narrated that Abu Bakr entered in on a woman from Ahmas called Zaynab and saw that she wasn\\u2019t speaking to anyone. He asked, Why isn\\u2019t she speaking? They said, She vowed to perform Hajj without speaking to anyone. He said to her, Speak, for this is not permissible. This is from the deeds of jahiliyyah (preIslamic era). So she began speaking, and asked him: Who are you? He said, A man from the muhajirin (emigrants). She asked, Which muhajirin? He said, Quraysh. She asked, Which branch of Quraysh are you from? He said, You ask too many questions. I am Abu Bakr. She asked, How long will we remain in this good state of affairs that Allah has brought to us after jahiliyyah? He said, You\\u2019ll remain like this as long as your a\\u2019immah (leaders) treat you with justice. She asked, And what are the a\\u2019immah? He said, Didn\\u2019t your people have leaders and nobility whose orders they obeyed? She said, Yes. He said, They are the a\\u2019immah of the people.\",\"{He (Ibrahim) pleaded, And also (leaders) from my offspring.\\u2019}\",\"{(Allah) said, My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.\\u2019}\",\"A number of scholars used this verse as evidence that the imam must be a man of justice, good conduct, and virtue, and have the strength to fulfill his role. [They say that] such an imam is the one whom the Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded the Muslims not to rebel against, as mentioned earlier. As for the sinful, unjust, immoral tyrant, then such an individual doesn\\u2019t qualify for this position on account of the statement of Allah, {My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.} It was for this reason that Ibn Az-Zubayr and AlHusayn Ibn Ali revolted. Likewise, the best of the people of Iraq and their scholars revolted against Al-Hajjaj, and the people of Madinah expelled the tribe Bani Umayyah from Madinah and then revolted against them (the Umayyad ruler), resulting in (the massacre of) Al-Harrah which Muslim Ibn Uqbah brought down on them. [AhkamulQur\\u2019an, 2:108]\",\"{And (remember) when Ibrahim was tried by his Lord with certain words (i.e. commands) and he fulfilled them. (Allah) said, Indeed, I will make you a leader for mankind.\\u2019 (Ibrahim) pleaded, And also (leaders) from my offspring.\\u2019 (Allah) said, My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.\\u2019} [AlBaqarah: 124]\",\"Ibn Kathir (rahimahullah) states, His (subhanahu wa ta\\u2019ala) statement: {with certain kalimat}, means with laws, commands, and prohibitions. The term kalimat can be used to refer to statements concerning the qadar (divine decree) of Allah. An example of this is the statement of Allah (subhanahu wa ta\\u2019ala) about Maryam, {and she believed in the kalimat (words) of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient} [At-Tahrim: 12]. It can also be used in a shar\\u2019i context, as in the statement of Allah (subhanahu wa ta\\u2019ala), {And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can alter His kalimat (words)} [Al-An\\u2019am: 115], meaning His shar\\u2019i kalimat, which include things that Allah informs us of and commands that He requires us to obey. An example of the shar\\u2019i usage of the term kalimat is the noble verse in discussion, {And (remember) when Ibrahim was tried by his Lord with certain kalimat and he fulfilled them}, meaning he carried them out. {(Allah) said, Indeed, I will make you a leader for mankind.\\u2019}, meaning as a reward for his actions. On account of obeying Allah\\u2019s commands and avoiding His prohibitions, Allah made Ibrahim an imam for mankind and an example to be followed. [Tafsir Ibn Kathir: Volume 1]\",\"Ibn Abbas explained the term kalimat as follows, The kalimat with which Allah tried Ibrahim and he fulfilled were, firstly, the command to separate from his people for the sake of Allah. Likewise, his debate with Namrud where he brought to his attention the seriousness of the issue that Namrud opposed him on. Likewise, the patience he displayed \\u2013 as terrifying as it was \\u2013 when Namrud threw him into the fire and he was about to be burned alive for the sake of Allah.

Then he said, We were on a journey with the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam), and we stopped at a place. Some of us were setting up our tents, others were competing in shooting arrows, and others were grazing their animals, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) called us to gather for prayer. We gathered around the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wa sallam) and he said, Indeed, no messenger has come before except that it was his duty to guide his people to what he knew to be good for them, and warn them against what he knew to be bad for them. The wellness of this Ummah of yours is in its beginning. In its end, it will be afflicted with tribulations and with things that you disapprove. There will be tribulations, each one eclipsing the one before it in severity. There will be tribulations [so severe] that the believer will say, This will be what destroys me.\\u2019 Then it will end, and another tribulation will follow, and the believer will say, This is the one [that will actually destroy me]. This is it.\\u2019 Whoever wishes to be saved from the fire and enter paradise should die believing in Allah and the Last Day, and should treat people the way he wishes to be treated.

The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is no longer a state in name only. It is a physical, if extralegal, reality on the ground. Unacknowledged by the world community, ISIS has carved a de facto state in the borderlands of Syria and Iraq. Stretching in a long ellipse roughly from al-Raqqah in Syria to Fallujah in Iraq (with many other noncontiguous islands of control in both Iraq and Syria), this former Al Qaeda affiliate holds territory, provides limited services, dispenses a form of justice (loosely defined), most definitely has an army, and flies its own flag. ... ISIS has created a multi-ethnic army; almost a foreign legion, to secure its territory.\\\" ... \\\"Finally, this new reality presents a challenge that rises above a mere counter-terrorism problem. ISIS no longer exists in small cells that can be neutralized by missiles or small groups of commandos.

Allah (subh?nah) ordered His messenger with such, and He did not say, This does not apply to your Ummah after you.\\u2019 His cousin Abdull?h Ibn Abb?s (radiyall?hu anhum?) also called to mub?halah when some censured him regarding some matters of fur?\\u2019, and none of the Sah?bah criticized him for mub?halah. Al-Awz?\\u2019? called Sufy?n ath-Thawr? to it over the matter of raising hands, and no one criticized him for such. Thus the mub?halah entails fully establishing the proof [Z?d al-Ma\\u2019?d].\",\"For example, Ibn Hajar called a proponent of the heretic Ibn Arab? to mub?halah. He told him to say, O Allah, if Ibn Arab? is upon deviance, then curse me with Your curse. Ibn Hajar in turn said, O Allah, if Ibn Arab? is upon guidance, then curse me with Your curse. After two months, the heretic was afflicted with blindness and then died.

So they ceased to perform the mub?halah\",\"Mub?halah was also part of the da\\u2019wah of Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b (rahimahull?h), who said, I call those who oppose me to one of four matters: either the Book of Allah, or the Sunnah of Allah\\u2019s Messenger, or the Ijm?\\u2019 (consensus) of the scholars. If he is stubborn and insists on opposing our da\\u2019wah, I call him to a mub?halah\",\"Allah said, \\\"I am according to my slave's expectations of Me.

The proof for this is your setting of conditions to accept Shaykh al-Muhaysin?\\u2019s initiative. This in general is a form of examining people\\u2019s creeds, not any people, rather that of the best people. I mean the muj?hid?n including the different muj?hid groups like the Islamic Front, Jayshul-Muj?hid?n, and others [The Mub?halah]. Ash-Sh?m? also said, Describing the fighting taking place as a battle between the Dawlah group on one side and those who stand with Jarb? and Idr?s [two SNC leaders] on the other, is far from the truth.

I said to one of them \\u2013 after he had denied the prophethood of the Prophet, Your denial of his prophethood entails slandering the Lord of the universe, belittling Him, and attributing to Him the worst of all blemishes. Before the discussion with you was about the Messenger and now it is about the Lord ta\\u2019?l? being free of all imperfections.\\u2019 He said, How can you say such?\\u2019 So I said to him, Clarifying such is my responsibility, so listen now. You claim that he was not a messenger rather he was a conqueror king who conquered the people by his sword until they yielded to him. And he spent 23 years lying against Allah and saying, I was revealed to,\\u2019 and he was not revealed to. He commanded me,\\u2019 and He did not command him. He forbade me [from doUnderstanding The Hikmah in Allah\\u2019s Actions ing something],\\u2019 and He did not forbid him. Allah said such and such,\\u2019 and He did not say such. He made such and such hal?l, such and such har?m, such and such w?jib, and such and such makr?h,\\u2019 and He did not make any of such hal?l nor har?m nor w?jib, rather he did these things on his own by lying and fabricating things against Allah, His prophets, and His angels. Thereafter he spent 23 years apathetically killing His slaves, spilling their blood, taking their wealth, enslaving their women and children, while they had no sin save rejection of and opposition to him, and throughout all this he says, Allah ordered me with this,\\u2019 and Allah did not order him. And in addition to this, he endeavors to change the religions of the messengers, abrogate their laws, and undue their traditions. This is his condition in your view. So either the Lord ta\\u2019?l? knows about this, hears of it and his condition, sees and witnesses him, or not. So if you claim that all this is away from Allah, and He did not know of it, then you have slandered the Lord ta\\u2019?l? and attributed extreme ignorance to Him, since He did not hear of this great event, nor know of it, nor see it. And if you claim that rather this occurred with His knowledge, awareness, and under His vision, you will be asked if He was able to change such, hold him back, and prevent him, or not. If you say that He was incapable of such, you have attributed weakness to Him and negated His rub?biyyah, thereby this human along with his followers were more capable of achieving their desires. And if you say that rather He was capable but He consolidated him, supported him, gave him mastery over the creation, and did not support His awliy?\\u2019 and the followers of His messengers, then you have attributed to Him the worst of foolishness, oppression, and lack of wisdom. That would be the case if He merely allowed him to do what he did. So what if He Himself was his support, the answerer of his supplications, the destroyer of those opposing and contradicting him, the confirmer of his claim with many forms of sanction, and the revealer of signs upon his hands \\u2013 signs that if the people of the earth were all to gather and work together, they would not be able to produce just one of such signs and would fail in doing so. And at every moment He creates for him causes of victory, consolidation, ascension, and abundance of followers, in a manner that is abnormal? Therefore it becomes clear that the one who denies him to be a messenger and prophet has indeed cursed Allah, slandered Him, and attributed ignorance, weakness, and foolishness to Him!\\u2019 I then said to him, This is not contradicted by the oppressive kings that Allah granted with consolidation upon the earth for a period of time and then He destroyed their existence, annihilated their traditions, and erased their traces and tyranny, for they had not practiced any of this, nor were they aided and supported. Nor did signs appear at their hands. Nor did the Lord ta\\u2019?l? confirm them with His consent, actions, or speech. Rather their condition was like Pharaoh, Nimrod, and their likes \\u2013 opposite of that of the Messenger. This is also not contradicted by the claimants of prophethood from amongst the liars. Rather their condition is opposite of that of the Messenger from every angle. Instead, their condition was from the clearest of proofs confirming the truthfulness of the Messenger. It was from the wisdom of Allah (subh?nah) that the likes of these came out to existence so that the condition of the liars became apparent and distinct from that of the truthful. Therefore, their appearance was from the clearest of proofs for the truthfulness of the messengers and showed the difference between these liars and the messengers, because things become clear when their opposites appear. And the good of something is shown by its opposite. Thus, awareness of the doubts used to argue falsehood directs one to the truth and its proofs.\\u2019 He then said, I seek refuge with Allah. We do not say he is an oppressive king. Rather he is a noble prophet. Whoever follows him is from the blissful\\u2026\",\"(Al-Qamar: 1-6) \\\"The Hour has come near, and the moon has split [in two].

Allah has praised the believers for their belief in the unseen, as He said, {They believe in the unseen} [Al-Baqarah: 3]. The companions of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) believed in both what they witnessed and what they could not see, for they believed in Allah and the Day of Judgment without seeing either of them, and they believed in the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) having seen and witnessed him. The revelation would descend [upon him] in their company, and they would see the signs and witness the miracles. The last part of this ummah believes in what the first part of the ummah believed in of the unseen, and believes in what the first part of the ummah believed in as eyewitnesses. This latter belief is their belief in the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), for they do not see the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), and because of that they\\u2019ve become the most wondrous people in faith, as reported [in the had?th] of Ibn Abb?s (radiyall?hu anhum?) that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, The most wondrous people in faith are a people who come after me and believe in me without having seen me, and they attest to my truthfulness without having seen me. So they are my brothers\\u2019 [reported by Im?m Ahmad] [Ma\\u2019?n? al-Akhb?r].\",\"Ibnul-Qayyim (rahimahull?h) said, [Indeed] Allah subh?nah? sent His Messenger while the people of the earth were following various religions. Among them were idol worshippers, fire worshippers, image worshippers, cross worshippers, Jews, mandaeans, and philosophers. When Islam first began to emerge it was something strange, and anyone who embraced it and responded to Allah and His Messenger became a stranger in his district, his tribe, his family, and his clan. Thus, those who responded to the da\\u2019wah of Islam left their tribes. Rather, they were lone individuals who emigrated from their tribes and clans, and entered into Islam. Therefore, they were the strangers, in reality, until Islam had emerged, its da\\u2019wah had spread, and the people entered into it in multitudes, such that they were no longer strangers. Then it began to part and fade, until it returned as something strange just as it first began. Rather, the true Islam, which Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions were upon, is something far stranger today than it was when it first emerged, even if its apparent features and characteristics are well-known and famous. For the real Islam is extremely strange, and its adherents are the strangest of strangers amongst the people\",\"Abud-Dard?\\u2019 (radiyall?hu anh) said that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Indeed the camp of the Muslims on the day of al-Malhamah al-Kubr? will be in al-Gh?tah, next to a city called Damascus, one of the best cities of Sh?m\",\"Abdull?h Ibn Amr (radiyall?hu anhum?) said that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, I saw as if a pillar of the Book was taken from underneath my pillow, so I looked and it was a shining light extending towards Sh?m. Verily faith, at the time of tribulations, is in Sh?m\",\"Ab? Dharr (radiyall?hu anh) said that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Sh?m is the land of congregation and dispersal [meaning resurrection]\",\"Shaykh Ham?d at-Tuwayjir? (rahimahull?h), in commenting on some of the narrations about the tribulations and battles in Sh?m, said, In these narrations is evidence that the bulk of at-T?\\u2019ifatul-Mans?rah (the victorious group) will be in Sh?m near the end of times, because the Khilafah will be there. They will continue to be there clearly upon the truth until Allah sends the pleasant breeze and it takes the soul of every person who has faith in his heart, as preceded in the sah?h narrations that the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Until the command of Allah comes while they are upon that [condition]\\u2019\",\"Abdull?h Ibn Amr (radiyall?hu anhum?) said that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, There will be hijrah after hijrah. The best people on earth will be those who keep to the land of Ibr?h?m\\u2019s hijrah. Then there will remain on the earth the worst of its people. Their lands will cast them out, Allah will hate them, and the fire will gather them together with the apes and swine\",\"The Prophet\\u2019s statement, And on the earth will remain the worst of the people [to the end of the had?th] refers to the period after Allah sends the pleasant breeze and it causes every person who has so much as the weight of a mustard seed of faith in his heart to pass away. Then there will remain only those who have no good in them whatsoever\",\"So it [the breeze] grasps them under their armpits, taking the soul of every believer and every Muslim. And there will remain the worst of the people, having intercourse as donkeys do [in front of other people as they watch]. So it is upon them that the Hour will be established\",\"Allah will send a cold breeze from the direction of Sh?m, so no one will remain on the face of the earth with so much as the weight of a mustard seed of goodness or faith in his heart except that it takes him. Even if one of you were to enter into the center of a mountain, the breeze would enter into it, until it takes him. Then there will remain the worst of the people, who have the agility of birds (in their haste to commit evil and satisfy their lusts) and the wits of vicious, predatory animals (in their hostility and oppression of one another). They do not know any good, nor do they denounce any evil\",\"Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahull?h) said, Islam in the end of times will be more manifest in Sh?m. [\\u2026] So the best of the people on the earth in the end of times will be those who keep to the land of Ibr?h?m\\u2019s hijrah, which is Sh?m\",\"bn Taymiyyah (rahimahull?h) also said, So he informed that the best of the people on the earth are those who keep to the land of Ibr?h?m\\u2019s hijrah, in contrast to those who pass through it or leave it3 . The land that Ibr?h?m made hijrah to is Sh?m. In this hadith, there are glad tidings for our companions who made hijrah from Harr?n (an area of Iraq) and elsewhere to the land of Ibr?h?m\\u2019s hijrah, and followed the path of Ibr?h?m and the religion of their prophet Muhammad (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam). Likewise, this had?th contains a clarification that this hijrah of theirs is equal to the hijrah of the Companions of Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) to Mad?nah, because hijrah is made to wherever the Messenger is and left an impact. And the land of Ibr?h?m\\u2019s hijrah, has been made for us equal to the land of our Prophet\\u2019s hijrah, because hijrah to Mad?nah was discontinued after the conquest of Makkah\",\"Abdull?h Ibn Haw?lah (radiyall?hu anh) said that Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Matters will run their course until you become mobilized armies: an army in Sh?m, and an army in Yemen, and an army in Iraq. Ibn Haw?lah said, Choose for me [which army to join] if I reach that time. He said, Go to Sh?m, for it is the best of Allah\\u2019s lands, and He draws His best slaves to it. And if you do not, then go to your Yemen and drink from your wells.

So the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) ordered them a she-camel that produced much milk and told them to drink from her urine and milk. They did so. When they got healthy, they killed the Prophet\\u2019s shepherd and led the camels away with them. The news then reached the Prophet in the early morning, so he sent after them. Prior to noon, they were captured and brought to him. He ordered their hands and their feet be cut off, their eyes be put out with hot iron, and they be thrown out on al-Harrah (an area covered with black stones near Mad?nah), so they would ask for water to drink, but not be given any water, until they died.

Then one third of them will flee; Allah will never forgive them. One third of them will be killed; they will be the best martyrs with Allah.

So arrogance is disdain of the truth, rejection of it, repelling it after awareness of it, and holding contempt for people with an eye of scorn, aversion, and belittlement. There is nothing wrong with such if it is done for Allah. The sign that such is done for Allah is that the person holds even more disdain and belittlement against himself.

First, I said in June, as the terrorist group ISIL began an advance across Iraq, that the United States would be prepared to take targeted military action in Iraq if and when we determined that the situation required it.

Second, at the request of the Iraqi government, we\\u2019ve begun operations to help save Iraqi civilians stranded on the mountain.

And these terrorists have been especially barbaric towards religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis, a small and ancient religious sect. Countless Iraqis have been displaced and chilling reports describe ISIL militants rounding up families, conducting mass executions, and enslaving Yazidi women. In recent days, Yazidi women, men, and children from the area of Sinjar have fled for their lives.

Thus, he became more ominous for his country than Gorbatchev was for his Union (the USSR).

He seconded with Iraq and opened up its treasures for them while they had not dreamt of drinking a sip of its water. And now they suck up its oil, loot its treasures, and enslave its men. Third, he panicked its r?fid? nusayr? tyrant \\u2013 through an embargo upon Syria \\u2013 into opening his country up to hundreds rather thousands of the Persians to nationalize themselves there and become supporters for the agent of the anti-Christ Nasrull?t who is called Nasr Allah\\u2019 and who just emerged from a so-called victory against the pinnacle of the Roman military machine (the Israeli military).

There [has] come into being a kind of a Shia-belt from Tehran through Baghdad to Beirut. And this gives Iran the opportunity to reconstruct the ancient Persian Empire, this time under a Shia label. From a geo-strategic point of view, I consider Iran a bigger problem than ISIS. ISIS is a group of adventurers with a very aggressive ideology. But they have to conquer more and more territory before they can become a geo-strategic, permanent reality. I think a conflict with ISIS \\u2013 important as it is \\u2013 is more manageable than a confrontation with Iran [NPR Interview].\",\"For now, however, the beginning of wisdom is to look at what is going on in Iraq and Syria and see it clearly. In both places all of those folks that multiple US administrations have identified as enemies of America are killing each other. In Syria, the Assad regime, Iran, and Lebanese Hizballah are killing Sunni mujahedin from all over the world, as well as their local allies and supporters. In turn, the Sunni Islamists in Syria are killing Assad\\u2019s troops, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, and Hizballah fighters. This is a perfect circumstance for the United States, all our enemies are killing each other and it is not costing us a cent or a life. Over in Iraq, we see much the same marvelous phenomena occurring. Multinational Sunni mujahedin and Saddam\\u2019s former military personnel are fighting and killing Maliki\\u2019s dictatorial regime, its Shia military forces, and their Iranian military supporters. And, as in Syria, Maliki and his gang are killing our Sunni Islamist enemies. In Iraq there also is the potential for a delightful bonus coming to fruition. If the United States stays out of the affair, the renewed war in Iraq may trigger a widespread Shia-vs-Sunni civil war in which our Muslim enemies \\u2013 as they are defined by our bipartisan political elite \\u2013 may begin to kill each other for a prolonged period and at unprecedented levels, and, again, at no cost to us in lives or dollars. So let us take both a deep breath and Lt. Col. Peters advice and sit back and watch what is going on in Syria and Iraq with equanimity and absolutely from the sidelines. Cheer for neither side, answer no one\\u2019s call for help \\u2013 especially not one from the near-frantic Neocons who now know they sank their beloved Israel with the 2003 invasion of Iraq \\u2013 and pray that Obama does not cooperate with Iran to restore Maliki\\u2019s Shia tyranny and thereby earn the eternal enmity of all of the Sunni world. He also said, What to do now? First, stay out of Iraq completely and utterly. To re-intervene would cost more American money and lives, and it would drive-up oil prices even faster.

But destroying ISIS, even in a couple of years, is just not possible. If we succeed in dismantling ISIS, we\\u2019re still left with a really problematic region. Robinson: This kind of partnered counterterrorism approach that the president has been talking about requires really refining how America deals with its partners. In this case, every partner is problematic. Iraqi security forces have crumbled in recent months. The Shia militias are problematic. The Sunnis could potentially turn against ISIS, but they are very wary of this new government. The Peshmurgas, the Kurdish militia, are least problematic. Finally, the Syrian opposition is terribly weak. Connable: I\\u2019m not sure anybody has a clear understanding of who\\u2019s who in Syria. Identities and loyalties shift. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to cripple the strategy, but it is a serious hurdle. The absence of a clearly envisioned end state condition is important. What is it that we want this group that we\\u2019re going to support to do after ISIS is defeated? The Free Syrian Army is the group we go to now. They\\u2019ve suffered battlefield defeats. They\\u2019re politically disorganized. I\\u2019m not sure what they would do with the Syrian state if they were able to assume control. Liepman: We need to remind ourselves that the president said, as did his military commanders, that this new phase of fighting against a determined and impressive enemy, will take some time. We need to be careful about how we define victory. We won\\u2019t vanquish this enemy. We\\u2019ll be lucky to degrade ISIS. We need patience. Rabasa: I\\u2019m afraid we may have fallen into ISIS\\u2019s trap. We probably had no choice but to extend the airstrikes into Syria, since that is ISIS\\u2019s base of operations. But by doing so we have escalated the campaign against ISIS without deploying sufficient force to seriously degrade or destroy them. Rabasa: Airstrikes will have diminishing returns as ISIS adjusts.

They have the softest of hearts. ?m?n is Yemen?, fiqh is Yemen?, and wisdom is Yemen?\",\"Al-H?fidh Ibn Rajab al-Hanbal? (rahimahull?h) said: Reflect on the statement of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) ?m?n is Yemen?, fiqh is Yemen?, and wisdom is Yemen?.\\u2019 He said this in praise of the people of Yemen and their virtues. Thus, he attested to their fiqh and ?m?n, and attributed this to them due to their having reached the highest degrees of fiqh, ?m?n, and wisdom. And we do not know of any group from amongst the Muslims who are less in speech than the people of Yemen or are less argumentative than them, whether from the early or later generations. Thus, he indicated that the knowledge and fiqh praised by Allah is the knowledge of Allah that leads one to love Him and be loved by Him, and to honor and revere Him, along with the knowledge that one requires of His commands and prohibitions. This was the case with the scholars of Yemen in the past, such as Ab? M?s? al-Ash\\u2019ar?, Ab? Muslim al-Khawl?n?, Uways al-Qaran? and others, without getting into any thing beyond that knowledge such as pitting the statements of the people against each other and excessively searching for their faults and slip-ups [\\u2026] as well as excessively searching for the unnecessary aspects of sciences that do not benefit one\\u2019s religious adherence, that serve to distract one from Allah and from being preoccupied with Him, that harden one\\u2019s heart towards His dhikr, and that cause the experts of such sciences to desire a high position and leadership of the people. None of this is praiseworthy, and indeed the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) used to seek refuge from knowledge that does not benefit [Reported by Muslim on the authority of Zayd]. In a had?th reported from him he said, Ask Allah for beneficial knowledge and seek refuge with Allah from knowledge that does not benefit\\u2019 [Reported by Ibn M?jah on the authority of J?bir]. In another had?th reported from him he said, Indeed, from knowledge is to be ignorant of some things\\u2019 [Reported by Ab? D?w?d on the authority of Buraydah]. The Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) disliked excessive and extensive speech, and loved concise speech. There are many ah?d?th reported from him to that effect and they would take long to mention [Majm?\\u2019 Ras?\\u2019il Ibn Rajab].\",\"He (rahimahull?h) also said, Ibn Mas\\u2019?d also said, You live in a time in which there are many scholars and few speakers, and there will come a time after you in which there will be few scholars and many speakers.\\u2019 Therefore, he who has extensive knowledge and speaks little is praiseworthy, and he who is the opposite is blameworthy. The Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) attested to the people of Yemen having ?m?n and fiqh. The people of Yemen are the least in speech from amongst the people and the least excessive in knowledge because their knowledge is beneficial knowledge in their hearts, and they only express with their tongues what they need to of that knowledge. And that is true fiqh and beneficial knowledge [Fadl Ilm as-Salaf].\",\"The muj?hid?n of Yemen said, Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) had given us glad tidings of Khil?fah upon the methodology of prophethood.

As for those of them who take part with their leaders in their cooperation with the crusaders and their aggression towards the Muslims, their ruling then is the ruling of a faction resisting the laws of Islam.3 As for those of their laymen who have not taken part in any aggression towards the Muslims, nor fought under the banner of the global crusade, our approach with them is to make da\\u2019wah, expose the realities, and clarify the extent of the crimes committed by their leaders against Islam and the Muslims [al-Liq?\\u2019 al-Maft?h \\u2013 al-Halqat al-?l?]\",\"The officers in the Counter-Religious Activism Department of National Security, who investigate religious issues and torture Muslims, I view them to be kuff?r on an individual level, for they know even more about the Islamic movements than most of the members of these movements themselves.

This is because a resistant apostate faction is fought as one. It is permissible to kill those of them who are fleeing, and to finish off those of them who are wounded; and this would be an act of killing one whose individual condition was unknown. This is the rule because distinguishing the condition of individuals is done if they are maqd?r alayhim (under the power of Muslims); these individuals are not maqd?r alayhim. So the obligatory defensive jih?d is not to be disrupted for the sake of distinguishing the condition of individuals [al-Liq?\\u2019 al-Maft?h \\u2013 al-Halqat al-?l?].\",\"He also said, Making takf?r of the armies and the security institutions is an issue that requires elaboration. My view is that the officers in the Counter-Religious Activism Department of National Security and their likes, who investigate Muslims and torture them, are kuff?r on an individual level. The result of the differing on the issue is very minute and is limited to personal rulings, such as marriage and inheritance. However, from the practical perspective regarding fighting them, there is no difference between the two views.

Allah then guided by the truth whoever answered him, and Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) struck those who turned away from Him by His permission, until they entered Islam either willingly or grudgingly. Then Allah took His Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) after he had carried out Allah\\u2019s order, sincerely advised his Ummah, and fulfilled what he was responsible for. Allah had clarified this to him and the people of Islam in the revealed book. He said, {Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die} [AzZumar: 30]. He also said, {And We did not grant to any man before you eternity, so if you die \\u2013 would they be eternal?} [Al-Anbiy?\\u2019: 34].

He guards His religion and exacts revenge upon His enemy. I advise you with taqw? of Allah, your duty towards Allah, and what your Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) came with. And I advise you to take as guidance his guidance and grasp the religion of Allah, for anyone whom Allah does not guide is deviant, anyone whom He does not decree wellbeing for is afflicted, and anyone whom Allah does not aid is abandoned. So whomever Allah guides is guided and whomever He leaves astray is deviant. Allah (ta\\u2019?l?) said, {He whom Allah guides is the guided, but he whom He leaves astray \\u2013 never will you find for him a protecting guide} [Al-Kahf: 17], and no deed will be accepted from him in the Duny? until he accepts Him. no repentance or ransom will be accepted from him in the Hereafter. It has reached me that some of you turned back from their religion after accepting Islam and acting in accordance with it, out of delusion about Allah, ignorance of His affair, and in response to Shayt?n. Allah (ta\\u2019?l?) said, {And [mention] when We said to the angels, Prostrate to ?dam, and they prostrated, except for Ibl?s. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange} [Al-Kahf: 50]. And He said, {Indeed, Shayt?n is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze} [F?tir: 6]. I have sent to you so and so [Kh?lid Ibn al-Wal?d] with an army of the Muh?jir?n, the Ans?r, and their good followers, and I\\u2019ve ordered him to not fight anyone or kill anyone until he calls him to the call of Allah. Whoever answers him, accepts the truth, halts his evil, and does good, my envoy will accept this from him and will aid him in it. If he refuses, I\\u2019ve ordered him to wage war against them over their refusal, to not spare anyone he is able to kill, to burn them alive with fire, to kill them in a severe manner using all means, to enslave their women and children, and to not accept from any one of them anything but Islam. Whoever follows it, then it is best for him. And whoever leaves it, then he cannot incapacitate Allah. I\\u2019ve ordered my envoy to read this message in every gathering of yours and the signal is the adh?n. [I\\u2019ve said to my army] if the Muslims perform adh?n and they [the apostates] do not perform adh?n, then rush to kill them. And if they [the apostates] perform adh?n, then restrain yourselves from attacking them until you ask them to deliver what is obligatory upon them [the zak?h]. If they refuse, then rush to kill them. If they agree, it will be accepted from them, and my envoy will make them carry out their duties. [T?r?kh at-Tabar?; Al-Bid?yah wan-Nih?yah]\",\"Al? Ibn Ab?

He (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) also described the sword as being the key to Jannah\",\"I mentioned before in previously discussed principles that Islam \\u2013 the religion of Allah with which He revealed His books and sent His messengers \\u2013 is that the slave yuslim (submits) to Allah, the Lord of the creation, and thus, he yastaslim (submits) to Allah alone without giving Him partners and that he be s?lim (purely) for Him, in that he worships Him while not worshipping other than Him, as is made clear by the best word and the head of Islam l? il?ha illall?h. And it has two opposites: kibr and shirk. For this reason, it was reported that N?h (alayhis-sal?m) ordered his children with l? il?ha illall?h and subh?nall?h and forbade them from kibr and shirk [Reported by Im?m Ahmad on the authority of Abdull?h Ibn Amr], as in a hadith I mentioned elsewhere. Indeed, the one who abstains due to arrogance from worshipping Allah does not worship Him, so he is not mustaslim (submitting) to Him, and he who worships Him and worships others with Him is a mushrik towards Him, so he is not s?lim for Him, rather he has shirk towards Him. The word Islam includes the two meanings, istisl?m (submission) and sal?mah which is sincerity. And it is known that all the messengers were sent with the general Islam consisting of this [Al-?m?n al-Awsat]. He (rahimahull?h) also said: The word Islam\\u2019 can be used in two ways, transitively, as in His statement, {And who is better in religion than one who aslama (submits) himself to Allah while being a doer of good} [AnNis?\\u2019: 125], and His statement, {I have aslamtu (submitted) myself to Allah, and so have those who follow me. And say to those who were given the Scripture and to the unlearned, Have you aslamtum (submitted)? And if they aslam? (submit), they are rightly guided; but if they turn away \\u2013 then upon you is only the duty of notification. And Allah is Seeing of the servants} [?l Imr?n: 20], and his statement (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) in the du\\u2019?\\u2019 before sleep, I aslamtu (have submitted) myself to You\\u2019 [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of al-Bar?\\u2019 Ibn ?zib]. It is also used intransitively, as in His statement, {When his Lord said to him, aslim (submit), he said I aslamtu (have submitted) to the Lord of the worlds} [Al-Baqarah: 131]. And it encompasses two meanings, the first is obedience and submission; the second is dedicating that sincerely to Him alone, as in His statement, {Allah presents an example: a slave owned by quarreling partners and another salam (purely) for one man \\u2013 are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know} [Az-Zumar: 29]. Its incarnation is the statement l? il?ha illall?h\",\"Rather Islam is istisl?m (submission) to Allah alone. The word Islam entails istisl?m and dedicating such sincerely to Allah. More than one scholar has mentioned this including the specialists in Arabic such as Ab? Bakr Ibn alAnb?r? and others. Some of the commentators have considered these two meanings to be two different interpretations, as a group of them including al-Baghaw? said, The Muslim is the mustaslim (submitter) to Allah. It has also been said he is the mukhlis (sincere one).\\u2019 The reality is that the Muslim is he who gathers both meanings in himself, for whoever does not yastaslim (submit) to Him, is not a Muslim, and whoever istaslam (submitted) to other than Him as he does for Him, is not a Muslim. Whoever istaslam (submitted) to Him alone is a Muslim, as in the Qur\\u2019?n, {Yes, whoever aslama (submits) his face to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve} [Al-Baqarah: 112] [An-Nub?w?t].6 It is clear then that sal?m (peace) is not the basis of the word Islam, although it shares the same consonant root (s-l-m) and is one of the outcomes of the religion\\u2019s sword, as the sword will continue to be drawn, raised, and swung until ?s? (Jesus \\u2013 alayhis-sal?m) kills the Dajj?l (the Antichrist) and abolishes the jizyah. Thereafter, kufr and its tyranny will be destroyed; Islam and its justice will prevail on the entire Earth. Then, it will be said to the earth, let your fruits grow and yield your blessings. On that day, a group will eat from a single pomegranate and take shade under its bowl-shaped peel. Milk will be blessed so much so that the young female camel will suffice a very large group of people, and a young female cow will suffice a tribe of people, and a young female sheep will suffice a clan of people\",\"The sky will be permitted to pour its rain and the land to yield its plants, so even if you were to plant a seed on a stone, it would spring.

Its enemies are numerous, but disunited and without a common plan. Neither the Iraqi nor the Syrian armies, its chief military opponents, are strong enough to over-run the jihadi state.So long as Isis continues to exist, it retains the capacity to dominate the political and media agenda for days at a time by threatening the public execution of hostages. These grizzly events, as we have seen with the Japanese and Jordanian hostages, are stage managed in order to gain maximum publicity and inspire general terror. Isis has suffered setbacks, but has also had successes. This week, its forces were finally driven out of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani after a siege lasting 134 days, in which it suffered heavy losses from 606 US air strikes. But elsewhere in Syria, Isis has been advancing towards the city of Homs as well as gaining strength south of Damascus and at alQalamoun, close to eastern Lebanon. By one account, Isis has won control of territory since last September where one million Syrians live, in addition to the area it already held. In Iraq, government forces have made advances in the provinces around Baghdad, but earlier this week bullets hit a plane and wounded passengers over Baghdad International Airport, forcing major airlines to stop flying there. This isolates the Iraqi capital and, though the airport is not completely closed, Isis could probably achieve this at any moment. He then went on to say: According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, the number of foreign fighters joining Isis in Iraq and Syria has risen from 15,000 last October to 20,000 today. A fifth of these come from Western Europe. Isis has also conscripted fighters in the territories it controls. Isis is being squeezed militarily and economically, but there is no sign of it imploding. Even its loss of Kobani is not necessarily a sign of weakness, since it held on for months despite fighting \\u2026 [the] Syrian Kurds, backed by an intensive US air bombardment in a confined place. Western analysts are encouraged by the number of experienced Isis commanders killed last year, but its ideology is built around martyrdom, and the high casualty rate among leaders shows that they fight in the frontline. President Obama says America\\u2019s main effort is in Iraq but unless it can rebuild the Iraqi army then it will be near impossible to defeat Isis there. And so long as Isis continues, so too will high profile hostage-taking and executions.\",\"A small victory in Syria is no reason to celebrate as the Islamic State gets stronger. US officials are celebrating a modest victory in the war against the Islamic State in Syria \\u2013 the apparently successful defense of the Kurdish town of Kobane, on the border with Turkey.

But perhaps the most significant fact about Kobane is that it consumed 75 percent of the nearly 1,000 airstrikes carried out by allied planes throughout Syria since September \\u2026 In the rest of the Syrian territory it controls, including its capital of Raqqa, the Islamic State \\u2026 is growing stronger rather than weaker.\",\"The president promises ISIS will be destroyed. Instead, it is only spreading \\u2026 Coalition forces did finally beat back ISIS in the key border town of Kobani \\u2026 It reportedly took 75 percent of all the air strikes launched there so far to accomplish it.

This is what began to be apparent these days, for after the announcement of the State, the Islamic mission conflicted with the nationalist mission adopted by almost all colors of the spectrum in Iraq, and this is what all the different jabh?t ad-dir?r (harmful fronts) which were announced and formed have declared openly and repeatedly.

And because the reality of their armies [the Sur?r? factions] is a lie especially after the sincere ones in their ranks joined us, their only option was to stand with the occupation against the Islamic State because the nationalist mission, which they argued for, gathered support for, and unified for, is the same mission desired by the occupation.

And we say it is statements and actions. The Murji\\u2019ah obliged Jannah for one who testifies that there is no god but Allah while he resolves in his heart to abandon the obligations3 . They called abandonment of the obligations a sin just like any other sin, although they are not equal, for committing sins without istihl?l (considering the sin to be hal?l) is merely sinful, whereas abandoning the obligations consciously without ignorance or excuse is kufr. What clarifies this is the matter of ?dam (alayhis-sal?m), Ibl?s, and the Jewish rabbis. As for ?dam, then Allah (azza wa jall) forbade him from eating from the Tree and made it har?m for him, but he consciously ate from it to become an angel or become immortal, so he was called disobedient without kufr. As for Ibl?s (may Allah curse him), then Allah obligated upon him a single prostration but he consciously refused it, so he was called a k?fir. As for the Jewish rabbis, then they knew the description of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) and that he was a prophet and messenger, just as they knew their own children, and they acknowledged this with their tongues, but they did not follow his Shar?\\u2019ah, so Allah (azza wa jall) called them kuff?r. So violating the prohibitions is like the sin of ?dam (alayhis-sal?m) and that of other prophets. As for abandoning the obligations with refusal, then it is kufr like the kufr of Ibl?s (may Allah curse him). As for abandoning the obligations with awareness but without refusal, then it is kufr like the kufr of the Jewish rabbis. And Allah knows best\",\"Al-Humayd? (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 219AH) said, I was told of people who say, Whoever acknowledges the prayer, zak?h, fasting, and hajj, but does not perform any of them until he dies, and prays with his back to the Qiblah until he dies, then he is a believer as long as he doesn\\u2019t deny these obligations, if he knows that not denying these obligations ensures his faith and if he acknowledges the obligations and the direction of the Qiblah.\\u2019 I said: This is open kufr and in opposition to Allah\\u2019s book, His Messenger\\u2019s Sunnah, and the Muslims\\u2019 scholars. Allah (ta\\u2019?l?) said, {And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zak?h. And that is the correct religion} [Al-Bayyinah: 5] [Al-L?lik?\\u2019?]. Im?m Ahmad also commented, Whoever says this has disbelieved in Allah and rejected Allah\\u2019s order and what the Messenger came with\",\"Ish?q Ibn R?hawayh (rahim?hull?h \\u2013 d. 238AH) said, The Murji\\u2019ah fell into extremism to the point that some of them said, Whoever abandons the obligatory prayers, the Ramad?n fast, the zak?h, the hajj, and the obligations in general without denying their obligatory status, then we do not make takf?r of him and his matter is with Allah thereafter because he acknowledges these obligations.\\u2019 These are the Murji\\u2019ah about whom there is no doubt\",\"{And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the mushrik?n wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush.

The Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah\\u2019s Messenger, to establish the prayer, to give the zak?h, to fast Ramad?n, and to perform hajj if you are able to. In another narration, Jibr?l asked him, If I do so, then I am a Muslim? He replied, Yes\",\"They also use as a proof the had?th of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), I was ordered to fight the people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah\\u2019s Messenger, establish the prayer, and pay the zak?h. If they do so, then they have protected their blood and wealth from me except by the right of Islam. And their account is with Allah\",\"They also use as a proof the had?th of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), Whoever prays our prayer, faces our Qiblah, and eats the meat of our slaughtered animals, then he is the Muslim who has the protection of Allah and His Messenger [\",\"Al-Marwaz? (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 294AH) said, We then mentioned the reports narrated from the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) declaring the kufr of he who abandons prayer, expelling him from the religion, and legalizing the killing of one who resists performing it. Also, similar reports reached us from the Sah?bah (radiyall?hu anhum). Nothing reached us from them contradicting this\",\"Al-Fudayl Ibn Iy?d (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 187AH) said, Allah said, {He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon N?h and that which We have revealed to you and what We enjoined upon ?br?h?m and M?s? and ?s? \\u2013 to establish the religion and not be divided therein} [AshSh?r?: 13]. So the religion is affirmation [of faith] through action which is as Allah described and how He ordered His prophets and messengers to establish the religion. Being divided therein is to abandon action and divide between statement and action. Allah (azza wa jall) said, {But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion} [At-Tawbah: 11]. So Allah required that repentance from shirk be in both word and deed by establishment of prayer and payment of zak?h. The people of Ra\\u2019y (false opinions) said, Prayer is not from ?m?n nor is zak?h nor any other of the obligations.\\u2019 They did so lying against Allah and opposing His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet. If what they said were true, Ab? Bakr would not have fought the people of apostasy\",\"Ibn Ab? ?sim (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 287AH) said, Ab? Bakr as-Sadd?q in my view is the most knowledgeable after Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) from amongst the Sah?bah, as well as the most virtuous, the most z?hid, the bravest, and the most generous of them. From the proof for this is his statement regarding the people of apostasy, when the Companions of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) debated with him so that he would accept from the apostates some of the religion, but he refused to accept anything less than all of what Allah obligated upon them or else he would fight them. He saw that committing kufr with regards to some of the revelation rendered their blood lawful, so he resolved to fight them, and he knew it to be the truth [As-Sunnah]. After the initial debate to which Ibn Ab? ?sim refers, the Sah?bah reached consensus. Umar (radiyall?hu anh) said, By Allah, as soon as I saw that Allah (azza wa jall) had opened Ab? Bakr\\u2019s heart to waging war, I realized he was upon the truth\",\"Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahull?h) also said, The Sah?bah did not say Do you acknowledge that it\\u2019s obligatory or do you deny its ruling?\\u2019 This wasn\\u2019t known from the Khulaf?\\u2019 and the Sah?bah. Rather, as-Sidd?q said to Umar (radiyall?hu anhum?), By Allah! If they were to resist giving me only a short rope that they used to give to Allah\\u2019s Messenger (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), I would fight them over their resistance to giving it.\\u2019 So he made their resistance towards payment the basis for the permissibility of fighting them, not their denial of its obligation. It was reported that a group from amongst them used to acknowledge its obligation but were stingy in paying it, but in spite of this the Khulaf?\\u2019 dealt with them all in the same manner: killing their fighters, enslaving their families, taking their wealth as booty, and testifying that their fighters are in Hellfire. And they labeled them all people of apostasy\",\"It was reported that one of those accused of Irj?\\u2019 was asked in al-Masjid al-Har?m if a man who said the following was a believer, I know the Ka\\u2019bah is true and that it is the House of Allah (azza wa jall) but I don\\u2019t know whether it is this one or not [in another narration: but I don\\u2019t know whether it is this one in Makkah or another one in Khur?s?n]. He replied, He is a believer. [Sufy?n ath-Thawr? said, I testify that in the sight of Allah he is from the k?fir?n until he knows that it is the Ka\\u2019bah erected in al-Haram.] He was then asked if a man who said the following was a believer, I know that Muhammad (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) is true and that he is a messenger [in another narration: I testify that Muhammad Ibn Abdill?h is a prophet], but I don\\u2019t know if he is the one who was in Mad?nah from Quraysh or another Muhammad [in one narration: or a man who was in Khur?s?n] [in another narration: but I don\\u2019t know if he is the one whose grave is in Mad?nah or not]. He replied, He is a believer. [Sufy?n ath-Thawr? said, I testify that in the sight of Allah he is from the k?fir?n.] [Reported by Abdull?h Ibn al-Im?m Ahmad, al-Khall?l, and al-L?lik?\\u2019?].

This knowledge is all found explicitly in the book of Allah and is widespread amongst the people of Islam. Their laymen convey it from those who came before them of Muslim laymen. They relate it from Ras?lull?h. They do not differ in its account nor in it being obligatory upon them. This general knowledge cannot be wrongly narrated nor misinterpreted, and disagreement is not possible with regards to it\",\"{A group [of you] He guided, and a group deserved [to be in] error.

He responded, The misleading im?ms\",\"Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahull?h) said, Bida\\u2019 (innovations) are derived from kufr, for there is no innovated opinion except that it entails a branch of the branches of kufr\",\"Al-Fudayl Ibn Iy?d (rahimahull?h) said, When I see a person from the people of Sunnah, it is as if I see a person from the Sah?bah of Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam); and when I see a person from the people of bida\\u2019, it is as if I see a person from the hypocrites [Sharh asSunnah \\u2013 al-Barbah?r?]. He also said, The sign of hypocrisy is that a man walks and sits with a person of bid\\u2019ah [Al-Ib?nah al-Kubr? \\u2013 Ibn Battah]. Ab? Qil?bah (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 104AH) said, I did not find any example like that of the people of bid\\u2019ah except hypocrisy, for Allah has mentioned hypocrisy as being conflicting words and conflicting deeds\",\"Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahull?h) also said, When the people of bida\\u2019 possess strength, they are similar to the kuff?r in considering it hal?l to kill the believers and in making takf?r of them, as the Khaw?rij, R?fidah, Mu\\u2019tazilah, Jahmiyyah, and their branches do. Some of them fight when they are a strong faction, like the Khaw?rij and Zaydiyyah. Others strive to kill individuals from their opponents either by using their authority or by deception. When they are weak, they are similar to the hypocrites. They use deception and hypocrisy, like the condition of the hypocrites. That is because innovations are derived from kufr, for when the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b possess strength, they wage war against the believers, and when they are weak, they act with hypocrisy towards them\",\"Accordingly, Sall?m Ibn Ab? Mut?\\u2019 (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 173AH) said that the scholar of the Salaf Ayy?b [as-Sikhtiy?n?] would label all the people of innovation as Khaw?rij; he would say, The Khaw?rij differ in name but agree on the sword\\u2019\",\"The founder of the Khaw?rij (Dhul-Khuwaysirah) said to the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), O Muhammad, be just! Umar Ibnul-Khattab (radiyall?hu anh) then said, O Ras?lull?h, let me kill this hypocrite. He answered, I seek the refuge of Allah to prevent the people from saying that I kill my companions. This person and his companions recite the Qur\\u2019?n and it does not go beyond their throats. They leave the religion like the arrow leaves the bow [Reported by Muslim on the authority of J?bir Ibn Abdill?h]. Here the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) did not denounce Umar\\u2019s labelling of the man as a hypocrite, rather the Prophet supported Umar\\u2019s claim by describing a trait of hypocrisy: religious deeds that have no reality in the heart \\u2013 recitation of the Qur\\u2019?n that merely passes through the throat. He then prevented Umar from killing the founder of this deviant sect citing the same reason for not killing the famous hypocrite Abdull?h Ibn Ubay (Ibn Sal?l) who said, If we return to al-Mad?nah, the more honored will surely expel therefrom the more humiliated. When Umar asked permission to kill Ibn Sal?l, the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) told him not to so that the people don\\u2019t say that Muhammad kills his companions [Reported by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim on the authority of J?bir Ibn Abdill?h]. The Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, They [the Khaw?rij] will kill the people of Islam and leave the people of idolatry alone. If I reach their time, I will kill them [until they are eradicated] just as the people of ?d were eradicated\",\"Hudhayfah (radiyall?hu anh) heard someone supplicate, O Allah, eradicate the hypocrites. Hudhayfah told him, If they were eradicated, you would not be able to exact revenge on your enemies\",\"This is in accordance with the had?th of the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), Indeed, Allah will aid this religion through people who have no share of the religion\",\"Ab? Hurayrah (radiyall?hu anh) said, We took part in a battle with Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam). He said about a man who claimed Islam, This person is from the people of Hellfire.\\u2019 When the fighting started, the man fought fiercely until he was wounded. It was said, O Ras?lull?h, the person you said was from the people of Hellfire fought today fiercely and has died.\\u2019 So the Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said, He went to Hellfire.\\u2019 Some of the people almost had doubts. While they were in that condition, they were told, He did not die. He had severe wounds and when night came, he could not bear with his wounds, so he killed himself.\\u2019 The Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) was informed about this and said, All?hu akbar! I testify that I am the slave of Allah and His messenger.\\u2019 He then ordered Bil?l to announce to the people that, Indeed, no one enters Jannah except a Muslim soul\\u2019 and that Indeed, Allah aids this religion by f?jir men.\\u2019\",\"Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), If four traits are found in a person then he is a complete hypocrite, and if he has one of the traits then he has a trait of hypocrisy until he abandons it. If he speaks he lies, if he makes a covenant he betrays it, if he makes a promise he breaks it, and if he argues he fajar (commits fuj?r)\",\"Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah said, The hypocrites who said, {We believe in Allah and the Last Day} [Al-Baqarah: 8] but who are not believers are those who are externally believers. They pray with the people. They perform hajj and participate in offensive battles. The Muslims and the hypocrites marry from each other and inherit from each other\",\"Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b said, The hypocrites at the time of Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) would perform jih?d f? sab?lill?h with their wealth and lives, pray the five daily prayers with Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam), and perform hajj with him\",\"{And if you ask them, they will surely say, We were only conversing and playing. Say, Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you \\u2013 We will punish another faction because they were criminals} [AtTawbah: 65-66],\",\"{They swear by Allah that they did not say [anything] while they had said the word of kufr and committed kufr after their Islam and planned that which they were not to attain.

So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter.

As long as they hold ground and continue to expand that ground, more and more will come. The fact that we are delaying means that the Caliphate continues to exist. They are not losing ground. They are not being discredited in the eyes of the Muslim world. They will get stronger. \\u2026 This is really important to understand. The reason the West had a thousand year war with Islam is that Islam was ever expanding. When Islam began to contract, it collapsed, and the caliphate was eliminated. Now they have established a caliphate. They are dead serious about expanding it. Unless we begin to take back that ground and make this caliphate just irrelevant in the eyes of the radical Muslim world, we are going to have a bigger and bigger problem.\",\"In the last six weeks we\\u2019ve seen groups in Pakistan have sworn allegiance to ISIS, Ans?r Bayt al-Maqdis in the Sinai Peninsula has sworn allegiance to them, Libyan groups have, and now Boko Haram. \\u2026 ISIS has billions of dollars. They have a network of communications. They\\u2019re reaching out to these people and it just shows you how deadly and effective ISIS is. ISIS truly is the most successful Sunni terrorist group in history because they\\u2019ve carved out a space for a nation-state. These groups recognize that. \\u2026 Those in these countries see this group as an Islamic group, and it\\u2019s an Islamic terrorist group but it\\u2019s a terrorist group that has become a nation-state.

Within a period of months after the fall of Damascus, Jordan will fall and Lebanon will fall. With that area of expansion for the most extreme Islamists, I think you will automatically see a beginning of a historic push of Islam towards Europe and I think, ultimately, Europe will be conquered, and that\\u2019s why I look at Syria as the center of gravity. That\\u2019s what we used to talk about in the army war college when we would study wars and the objective. There was always a center of gravity \\u2013 the thing which would determine the outcome of the war. If you defeated the center of gravity, then you won.

If it falls, then we will begin to see a very rapid advance of Islam on Europe and I think ultimately, potentially, the collapse of all of Europe.\",\"Obama\\u2019s own former defense secretary Chuck Hagel described the situation as one of the most challenging periods in history for American leadership. In an interview with CBS, Hagel went on to say, We\\u2019ve never seen an organization like ISIL that is so well-organized, so well-trained, so well-funded, so strategic, so brutal, so completely ruthless. We\\u2019ve never seen anything quite like that in one institution. Then they blend in ideology \\u2026 and social media.

The reason we said that the meaning of {and perform rib?t} is perform rib?t against your enemies and your religion\\u2019s enemies\\u2019 is because this is the wellknown meaning of the meanings of rib?t.

Islam is the religion of war. Your Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) was dispatched with the sword as a mercy to the creation. He was ordered with war until Allah is worshipped alone. He (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) said to the mushrik?n of his people, I came to you with slaughter\\u2019 [Reported by Im?m Ahmad from Abdull?h Ibn Amr]. He fought both the Arabs and non-Arabs in all their various colors. He himself left to fight and took part in dozens of battles. He never for a day grew tired of war \\u2026 His companions after him and their followers carried on similarly. They did not soften nor abandon war, until they possessed the Earth, conquered the East and the West, the nations submitted to them, and the lands yielded to them, by the edge of the sword. And similarly, this will remain the condition of those who follow them until the Day of Recompense. Our Prophet (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) has informed us of the Mal?him near the end of time.

And if the Crusaders today have begun to trouble the Muslims who continue to live in the lands of the cross by monitoring them, arresting them, and questioning them, then soon they will begin to displace them and take them away either dead, imprisoned, or homeless. They will not leave anyone amongst them except one who apostatizes from his religion and follows theirs. And you will remember what I now say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. O Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, and the rest of the kuff?r will not approve of you nor abandon waging war against you until you follow their religion and apostatize from yours.\",\"He then expounded on the obligation upon the Muslims during these wars before the Hour. He said, O Muslims! Do not think the war that we are waging is the Islamic State\\u2019s war alone. Rather, it is the Muslims\\u2019 war altogether. It is the war of every Muslim in every place, and the Islamic State is merely the spearhead in this war. It is but the war of the people of faith against the people of kufr, so march forth to your war O Muslims. March forth everywhere, for it is an obligation upon every Muslim who is accountable before Allah \\u2026 There is no excuse for any Muslim who is capable of performing hijrah to the Islamic State, or capable of carrying a weapon where he is, for Allah (tab?raka wa ta\\u2019?l?) has commanded him with hijrah and jih?d, and has made fighting obligatory upon him. And we call upon every Muslim in every place to perform hijrah to the Islamic State or fight in his land wherever that may be.\",\"He then warned against the propaganda of the crusaders by saying, America and its allies from amongst the Jews, Crusaders, R?fidah, secularists, atheists, and apostates claim that their coalition and war is to aid the weak and oppressed, help the poor, relieve the afflicted, liberate the enslaved, defend the innocent and peaceful, and prevent the shedding of their blood. They also claim to be in the camp of truth, good, and justice, waging war against falsehood, evil, and oppression, alongside the Muslims! Rather, they claim to defend Islam and the Muslims! Indeed, they lie.\",\"He then expounded in detail on the apathy of the t?gh?t rulers towards the Muslims and followed by saying, The Arabian Peninsula\\u2019s rulers have been exposed and disgraced and have lost their supposed legitimacy.\\u2019 Their treachery has become clear even to the laymen of the Muslims. And the reality of these rulers thereby became apparent. Therefore, their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders had no more use for them. And so their masters began to replace them with the Safaw? R?fidah and the Kurdish atheists. When ?l Sal?l realized their masters\\u2019 abandonment of them, their disposal of them like tattered shoes, and their replacement of them, they launched their supposed war against the R?fidah of Yemen. And it is not a storm of resolve, rather it is the kick of a dying person, by Allah\\u2019s permission, as he struggles during his last breaths.\",\"He then said, Today they claim to defend AhlusSunnah in Yemen against the R?fidah! Rather, they have lied, failed, and lost. Their war is nothing but an attempt to prove themselves once again to their masters from amongst the Jews and Crusaders. It is nothing but a desperate attempt to turn the Muslims away from the Islamic State whose voice The crusaders seek to bridge their relations with R?fid? Iran at the expense of crusader relations with the Arab taw?gh?t 56 FEATURE is high everywhere and whose reality has become clear to all the Muslims and therefore the Muslims began to gradually rally around it. Their storm is nothing but a storm of delusion after the fire of the R?fidah scorched their thrones and after the R?fidah\\u2019s march reached the people of the Arabian Peninsula, a matter that will lead thereafter to the Muslim public in the Arabian Peninsula rallying around the Islamic State since it defends them against the R?fidah. This is what frightens ?l Sal?l and the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula and makes their thrones tremble. This is the secret of their supposed storm,\\u2019 which, by Allah\\u2019s permission, will be their imminent end, for ?l Sal?l and the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula are not people of war nor do they have the patience for it. Rather, they are people of luxury and extravagance, people of intoxication, prostitution, dances, and feasts. They have become accustomed to the defense of the Jews and Crusaders for them and their hearts have drunk humiliation, disgrace, and subservience.\",\"He also called the Muslims to recognize the reality of this war. O Muslims everywhere, has the time not come for you to realize the truth of the conflict and that it is between kufr and ?m?n? See on which front the rulers of your lands stand and to which camp they belong. Has the time not come O Ahlus-Sunnah for you to know that you alone are the targets? This war is only against you and against your religion. Has the time not come for you to return to your religion and your jih?d and thereby bring back your glory, honor, rights, and leadership? Has the time not come for you to know that there is no might nor honor nor safety nor rights for you except in the shade of the Khil?fah?\",\"He said, O Ahlus-Sunnah in Iraq \\u2026 seek shelter \\u2013 after Allah \\u2013 with the Islamic State. What do you wait for after the truth has become clearer than the day and after the spiteful R?fidah exposed their reality? Here they are today slaughtering everyone considered from AhlusSunnah in Baghdad and elsewhere. No one was saved from them, even their allies, supporters, aids, tails, and dogs from the apostates who had once belonged to Ahlus-Sunnah, those in the Sahwah, army, police, and elsewhere, those whom the evil scholars confused into fleeing the implementation of Allah\\u2019s law in the territory of the Islamic State. So they became homeless, humiliated, fearful, and worrisome of the R?fidah\\u2019s cruelty, whereas the Muslims live in the territory of the Islamic State with might and honor, secure by Allah\\u2019s bounty alone, with a life of comfort, going about the affairs of their business, livelihood, and trade, enjoying the grace of living under the rule of their Lord\\u2019s law, and all praise and grace is Allah\\u2019s. Therefore, O Muslims, seek shelter \\u2013 after Allah \\u2013 with the Islamic State.\",\"He also warned of the possible attempt of the kuff?r to strike against the Islamic State wil?y?t in Sh?m before those in Iraq. Be patient and firm, and be cautious, for the enemies of Allah are mobilizing, thundering, increasing, and threatening the people of Mosul. We believe that their mobilization will be for ar-Raqqah and Halab before Mosul. So be cautious.\",\"Finally, he explained the growing weakness of the modern crusaders. O soldiers of the Islamic State, be firm, for you are upon the truth. Seek help through patience, for victory comes with patience and triumph is for those who are patient. Be patient, because the Crusaders are bleeding to death, the R?fidah are faltering, and the Jews are horrified and in dread.

That will put even more pressure on ISIS, while allowing the United States and the Islamist groups to get familiar with each other, understand each other\\u2019s perspectives and fears, and possibly even mitigate human suffering in Syria. Those ties would surely be valuable when it comes time to reconstruct the country.

They explained the map by briefly saying, Fear over the spread of Islamic State means parties often at odds now share a common enemy\\u2026 Parties that display friction or outright aggression toward one another are finding themselves aligned in a desire to counter Islamic State\\u2026 The greatest odd bedfellow of all: Islamic State threatens al-Qaeda as well as the West, meaning that, in fact, al-Qaeda and the US now have a shared enemy.\",\"The crusaders of the Small Wars Journal described the phenomenon briefly on 22 March 2015, Our rebel allies are predominately Sunnibased and include a healthy dose of Al-Qaida \\u2013 our sworn enemy in Ira[q] and Afghanistan has somehow managed to be on our side in Syria.\",\"A major crusader think-tank \\u2013 the Carnegie Endowment \\u2013 wrote on 24 March 2015, The West currently sees the Nusra Front as a threat. But Nusra\\u2019s pragmatism and ongoing evolution mean that it could become an ally in the fight against the Islamic State. \\u2026 Instead of putting Nusra and the Islamic State in the same basket, the West should look beyond the Nusra Front\\u2019s ideological affiliation and encourage its pragmatism as it seeks an end to the Syrian conflict.\",\"After describing the pragmatism of the Jawl?n? front (cooperation with everyone and non-implementation of the hud?d), the author said, Nusra could also benefit from US airstrikes against IS. The US listed the Nusra Front a terrorist organisation in December 2012, long before the emergence of IS, but since last year the US-led intervention in Syria and Iraq has largely focused on the aim of degrading and ultimately destroying\\u2019 IS. While coalition airstrikes have also targeted Nusra positions, the group is less of a priority for the US-led campaign. Should IS be significantly dented by the westernbacked campaign, \\u2026 Nusra looks best placed to fill the vacuum in the north, central and eastern parts of Syria. \\u2026 Nusra has even shown itself willing to work with the international community in that region, last year working with Qatar in negotiations to release 45 Fijian UN peacekeepers taken hostage in the Golan in September. In the long-term, [opposition media activist from Idlib, Juma al-Qassem] believes the Syrian people\\u2019s rejection of IS will push the opposition to embrace Nusra. \\u2026 And with any possible umbrella deal likely to include Islamist representatives, Nusra, better armed, funded and organised, would be best positioned to fill that role.\",\"The Carnegie Endowment wrote on 20 April 2015, The Islamic State seeks to infiltrate Jordan in many ways. Its most effective way of establishing itself is not by attacking across the border, but by coopting Jordanian extremist factions and exploiting the simmering social discontent among Jordanian youth. To counter these trends, the government has sought to exploit divisions between al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, releasing some clerics [alMaqdis? and al-Filist?n?] aligned with the former group and allowing them a degree of media visibility.\",\"The crusaders of War on the Rocks wrote on 13 April 2015, This much is clear, however: Mullah Omar still matters \\u2013 especially in South Asia, where two important developments are playing out. Both are directly tied to stability, which is Washington\\u2019s chief interest in the region. And regardless of his fate, Mullah Omar will have an impact on each of them. Development number one is the deepening influence of the Islamic State in South Asia. \\u2026 The second key trend is Kabul\\u2019s pursuit of reconciliation with the Taliban. \\u2026 Late last year, US officials suggested that American forces will no longer actively pursue Mullah Omar. They intimated that he no longer poses a direct threat to US troops. Taken at face value, this reasoning suggests that Washington is simply not that concerned about him anymore \\u2026 Then again, the US decision not to go after Omar may be an indication that it still regards him as relevant and useful. Washington may conclude that any and all roads to peace talks in Afghanistan lead through him, and that apprehending or attacking him would be a strategic disaster.\",\"Worst of all, Barak Mendelsohn wrote an article titled Accepting Al Qaeda \\u2013 The Enemy of the United States\\u2019 Enemy for Foreign Affairs on 9 March 2015. In it, he said, Since 9/11, Washington has considered al Qaeda the greatest threat to the United States, one that must be eliminated regardless of cost or time. After Washington killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, it made Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda\\u2019s new leader, its next number one target. But the instability in the Middle East following the Arab revolutions and the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and alSham (ISIS) require that Washington rethink its policy toward al Qaeda, particularly its targeting of Zawahiri. Destabilizing al Qaeda at this time may in fact work against US efforts to defeat ISIS. \\u2026 Today, al Qaeda, although still a grave threat, is only one of several emanating from the Middle East. Washington must not only contain Iran\\u2019s hegemonic aspirations, which threaten US allies, but also fight ISIS\\u2019 expansion. Washington\\u2019s failure to balance these diverging interests became apparent when it made the mistake of coupling the bombing of ISIS targets in Syria with attacks on al Qaeda\\u2019s Khorasan group \\u2026 In order for US President Barack Obama to fulfill his promise to degrade and ultimately destroy\\u2019 ISIS, he must weaken ISIS\\u2019 control of Mosul, Raqqa, and other large population centers, as well as stop its expansion. Inadvertently, the administration\\u2019s cautious approach to military intervention makes al Qaeda \\u2013 which views ISIS as a renegade offshoot \\u2013 an important player in curtailing ISIS\\u2019 growth. \\u2026 As long as Zawahiri is alive, the leaders of al Qaeda\\u2019s branches who are beholden to him by personal oath are less likely to shift allegiances and join ISIS. But if and when Washington succeeds in killing Zawahiri, the leaders of al Qaeda\\u2019s branches would have the opportunity to reassess whether to remain with al Qaeda or join Baghdadi\\u2019s caliphate \\u2026 More so than during the bin Laden era, al Qaeda\\u2019s cohesiveness depends on the ability of its leadership to hold the various franchises together, and it is unclear whether al Qaeda can endure another succession since al Qaeda\\u2019s veteran leaders have dwindled considerably in recent years, making it more dependent on old guard figures such as Zawahiri to maintain unity.

He replied, Yes, and there will be a severe retreat. The Muslims will prepare a detachment for fighting unto death that will not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death that will not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene between them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death that will not return but victorious. They will fight until night comes upon them; both sides will return without being victorious and the detachment will be wiped out. On the fourth day, the remnants of the people of Islam will arise to fight them and Allah will bring defeat upon their enemy. They will fight such a fight the like of which will not be seen (or which has not been seen), so much so that if a bird were to pass through their areas, it would fall dead before passing them. Thereafter, paternal relatives will count each other and find that after being one hundred, only one man is left from them. So what booty can be rejoiced over! And what inheritance can be divided!

It is not permissible to eat what they slaughter nor marry their women. Rather, they cannot be acknowledged with jizyah, for they are apostates from the religion of Islam, not Muslims, nor Jews, nor Christians. They do not recognize the obligation of the five daily prayers, nor the obligation of the Ramad?n fast, nor the obligation of hajj, nor the prohibition of what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited of dead animals, alcohol, and so on. And if they manifest the two testimonies of faith [there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger] alongside these tenets of creed, then they are kuff?r according to the agreement of the Muslims. \\u2026 As for the Druze, then they are the followers of Hashtak?n ad-Darz? who was one of the followers of alH?kim [the apostate Ubayd? ruler]. Al-H?kim sent him to the people of the valley of Taymull?h Ibn Tha\\u2019labah and called them to believe in the godhood of al-H?kim. They call him al-B?r? al-All?m\\u2019 [The Creator, the All-Knowing] and swear by him. They are from the Ism?\\u2019?liyyah who claim that Muhammad Ibn Ism?\\u2019?l abrogated the Shar?\\u2019ah of Muhammad Ibn Abdill?h g. They are worse in kufr than the extreme Sh?\\u2019ah. They claim that the world existed eternally and deny the obligations and prohibitions of Islam. They are from the B?tin? Qar?mitah [those who claim the religion has secret meanings contradicting its apparent meanings] who are worse in kufr than the Jews, the Christians, and the pagan Arabs. They ultimately strive to be philosophers upon the doctrine of Aristotle and his likes or the Maj?s. Their doctrine is a combination of the doctrines of the philosophers and the Maj?s. They hypocritically manifest Shiism He r also said describing the Druze, The kufr of these people is a matter over which the Muslims do not differ. Rather whoever doubts their kufr is a k?fir like them. They are not at the level of Ahlul-Kit?b nor the mushrik?n. Rather, they are from the most deviant kuff?r, and so the meat they slaughter is not hal?l. Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized. They are apostate heretics whose repentance cannot be accepted.2 Rather they are to be killed wherever they are found and cursed as they were described. It is not permissible to use them as guards, gatekeepers, or custodians. It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others. It is prohibited to sleep at their homes, accompany them, walk with them, or follow their funeral processions if their deaths are known. It is prohibited for the Muslims\\u2019 authorities to abandon the order of Allah by not executing the hud?d upon them He r also said describing the B?tiniyyah (which include the Druze), If these people are overcome, they manifest repentance because the basis of their doctrine is taqiyyah and concealment of their condition. Amongst them are those who will be known and amongst them are those who might not become known. So the best way to deal with them is to be cautious concerning their matter. They should not be allowed to remain together, nor should they be allowed to carry arms, nor should they be allowed to become from the soldiers. They should be forced to abide by the laws of Islam, including the five daily prayers and recitation of the Qur\\u2019?n. There should remain amongst them those who will teach them the religion of Islam and they should be left with these teachers \\u2026 And whoever is from the leaders of their deviance and manifests repentance should be expelled from their places and taken to the main lands of the Muslims where these sects have no manifest presence so that either Allah ? guides him or he dies upon his hypocrisy without harming the Muslims\",\"In another fatw? in which he mentioned the extreme kufr of the B?tiniyyah (who include the Druze and the Nusayriyyah) and their treacherous alliance with other kuff?r (the crusaders and the Tatars) against the Muslims, he said, Their harm upon the Ummah of Muhammad g is greater than the harm of the war-waging kuff?r like the kuff?r of the Tatars, the Franks [European crusaders], and others \\u2026 There is no doubt that jih?d against these people and the implementation of the hud?d upon them are from the greatest acts of obedience and obligations. This is better than jih?d against those who do not fight the Muslims from the mushrik?n and AhlulKit?b, for the jih?d against these people is from the jih?d against the apostates. As-Sidd?q and the Companions began with the jih?d against the apostates before the jih?d against the kuff?r from Ahlul-Kit?b. The jih?d against them preserves what has been conquered from the Muslims\\u2019 lands and so no one who intends to fight against the Muslims can enter these lands. As for jih?d against those who have not fought us from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b, then it is to further manifest the religion. And preserving assets is a priority over making gains. Also, their harm on the Muslims is greater than others\\u2019 harm. Rather, their harm is like the harm of those from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b who fight the Muslims. Rather, their harm on the religion is greater than the harm of the combatants from the mushrik?n and Ahlul-Kit?b. So it is obligatory upon every Muslim to attempt to do as much as he is able of this obligation against them. It is not permissible for anyone to hide what he knows of their secrets. Rather, he must spread them and make them public so that the Muslims know the reality of their condition. It is not permissible for anyone to cooperate with them by allowing them to remain amongst the soldiers and state employees. It is not permissible for anyone to be silent about establishing what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them. It is not permissible for anyone to forbid the establishment of what Allah and His Messenger ordered against them.

Bakr and the Sah?bah ? fought those who resisted the zak?h. The fuqah?\\u2019 after them agreed upon this.\\u2019 He then said, So any resistant party that resists some of the obligatory prayers, fasting, hajj, or resists abiding by the prohibition of spilling blood, looting wealth, alcohol, gambling, incest, or resists adherence to jih?d against the kuff?r or the enforcement of jizyah upon Ahlul-Kit?b, [in another fatwa of his in Majm?\\u2019 al-Fat?w? he adds, or resists commanding the good and forbidding the evil] or resists abiding by anything else of the obligations and prohibitions of the religion, those rulings which no one has an excuse for being ignorant of or abandoning and which the individual commits kufr by denying, then the resistant party is fought over these rulings even if it acknowledges them. This is something of which I know no difference between the scholars.\\u2019 He said, These \\u2013 according to the most judicious scholars \\u2013 are not on the same level as the bugh?t (the rebels). Rather they have exited Islam on the level of those who resisted zak?h.\\u2019 \\u2026 So if a person who adheres to all the laws of the religion but forcefully resists the prohibition of gambling, usury, or fornication is a k?fir whom it is obligatory to fight, how much more so is the case of he who practices shirk with Allah and is called to offer the religion sincerely to Allah and declare bar?\\u2019ah and kufr towards everything worshipped besides Allah, but instead he arrogantly refuses and is from the k?fir?n\",\"Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah ? said, explaining the obligation to fight the resistant parties, This is because Allah ? said in His book, {And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf?l: 39]. So, if some of the religion is for Allah and some of it is for other than Allah it becomes obligatory to fight them until the religion is for Allah alone. He ? said, {But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, let them [go] on their way} [At-Tawbah: 5]. He did not order to let them go except after their repentance from all types of kufr and after establishing prayer and giving zak?h. He ? said, {O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers. And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from Allah and His Messenger.} [Al-Baqarah: 278-279].4 He ? informed us that the resistant party, if it does not desist from usury, it has waged war against Allah and His Messenger. Usury is the last matter that Allah prohibited in the Qur\\u2019?n, so what He prohibited before it is even more certain. He ? said, {Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land} [Al-M?\\u2019idah: 33].5 Thus, any of those who forcefully resist obeying Allah and His Messenger have waged war against Allah and His Messenger. And whoever implements upon this Earth something other than the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ? has thus strived to spread corruption on the Earth\",\"Shaykh Abdul-Lat?f Ibn Abdir-Rahm?n Ibn Hasan Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahh?b ?, in refutation of those who permit supporting the apostates against the Muslims under the claim that they are only seeking their help, said, As for your permitting to seek their support, the argument is not on this issue, but rather on the issue of allying with them and bringing them here, and giving them control over an Islamic land wherein they demolished the rites of Islam, the principles of the religion, its fundamentals and its branches. And with their leaders is a set of manmade laws and a t?gh?t whom they setup in order to judge between people concerning their blood, their wealth, and other matters, with laws that oppose and go against the shar\\u2019? texts. If any issue arises, they look into it and judge by the manmade laws, and throw the book of Allah behind their backs. As for the issue of seeking help from them [meaning against other kuff?r], it is a matter in which there is a difference of opinion. The correct position, which the leading scholars are upon, is that it is completely prohibited. Their evidence is the had?th narrated by ?\\u2019ishah (radiyall?hu anh?) which is agreed upon by al-Bukh?r? and Muslim, and the had?th narrated by Abdur-Rahm?n Ibn Hab?b which is authentic and marf?\\u2019. Look for them and you will find them in the texts you have with you. Those who say it is permissible use as evidence a mursal from az-Zuhr?, and you know how mursal narrations are treated when they contradict the Qur\\u2019an and Sunnah. Furthermore, those who say it is permissible place some conditions: that it should be done for the good of the Muslims and the desire to benefit them, whereas in this case it contains destruction and devastation for them. They also stipulate that the mushrik?n should not have a fearful degree of power and authority, and this invalidates your position in this particular case. They also stipulate that the mushrik should not have any influence in opinion and decisionmaking, which is the opposite of what is taking place in this case. All this has been mentioned by the scholars of fiqh and the had?th commentators, and [ash-Shawk?n?] has mentioned this in Sharh al-Muntaq?\\u2019 [Naylul-Awt?r\\u2019] and has declared the mursal narration of az-Zuhr? very weak. And all this is regarding a mushrik fighting with the Muslims against another mushrik. As for a Muslim seeking the help of a mushrik against a b?gh? (outlaw), then no one has allowed this other than those who have strayed He also said on the same issue, The reality of the matter is more severe and far greater than the issue of merely seeking help and support. It is allying with them and removing the barrier protecting the people of Islam and tawh?d from them, removing the principles and fundamentals of Islam, shedding the blood of the Muslims, and violating their honor and wealth. This is the reality of the present situation. Because of this, open shirk and blatant kufr started to appear in the land to the extent that not even a trace of Islam remained to refer back to or depend on for salvation. How so, when the principles of tawh?d and ?m?n were destroyed, the rulings of the Qur\\u2019an and Sunnah were set aside, the first generations \\u2013 from amongst the people of Badr and Bay\\u2019at ar-Ridw?n \\u2013 were openly cursed, and shirk and R?fid? Sh?\\u2019ism emerged openly in those places and lands? And those who reduce the present situation to simply being a matter of seeking help from them, neither understand the issue, nor are aware of the disaster and calamity that has taken place\",\"So we say to them as the muj?hid leader Sa\\u2019?d Ibn Abdil-Az?z Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sa\\u2019?d (? \\u2013 died 1229 AH)7 in his letter to the Ottoman8 leader in Baghdad, Sulaym?n B?sh?, We only fight and declare the kufr of one who commits shirk with Allah, sets up a partner for Allah whom he calls upon just as he calls upon Allah, whom he slaughters for just as he slaughters for Allah, whom he vows oaths to just as he vows oaths to Allah, whom he fears just as he fears Allah, and whom he seeks rescue from at times of distress and need, as well as he who fights in defense of the idols and the domes built upon the graves, which have been taken as idols that are worshipped besides Allah. If you are truthful in your claim that you are upon the religion of Islam and are the followers of the Messenger ?, then demolish all those idols and flatten them to the ground, and repent to Allah from all shirk and bid\\u2019ah. Actualize the statement There is god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\\u2019 And whoever directs an act of worship to other than Allah from amongst the dead or living, prohibit him from doing so, and inform him that this is a matter that nullifies one\\u2019s Islam and resembles the religion of the idol-worshippers. And, if he does not refrain from that except if he is fought, then it is obligatory to fight him until he makes the religion, all of it, for Allah. And command your subjects to adhere to the rites of Islam and its pillars, including establishing prayer in congregation in the mas?jid, and if anyone abstains then discipline him. Likewise with the zak?h that Allah has obligated. It is collected from the wealthy and given to the eligible people whom Allah has mentioned. If you do this then you are our brothers. You will have the same rights as we have and you will have the same responsibilities as we have. Your blood and wealth will be prohibited for us. If, however, you continue upon this condition that you are in, and do not repent from the shirk that you are upon and adhere to the religion of Allah with which He sent His Messenger ? and abandon shirk and bid\\u2019ah, we will continue to fight you until you return to Allah\\u2019s religion, and traverse its straight path as Allah has commanded us to do, as in His statement, {And fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah} [Al-Anf?l: 39]. And He ? said, {Then kill the mushrik?n wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, let them go on their way} [At-Tawbah: 5]\",\"He ? also stated in another letter, If you claim that you do not worship other than Allah and are not pleased with such a deed, and do not encourage the people to do so, your actions \\u2013 both public and private \\u2013 disprove your claims. These false S?f? gatherings, accursed sites, and structures built over the graves, along with the act of directing Allah\\u2019s rights to these graves, including du\\u2019?\\u2019, sacrifice, oaths, fear and hope, and asking them for that which should not be asked for except from Allah, as well as praying there, touching them with the hope of attaining blessings, offering gifts to them, and other such disgusting and hideous activities, all exist among you openly. And he who does not take part in such deeds is pleased with them, and he defends the people who do these deeds with his wealth, his tongue, and his hands. The five daily prayers are likewise abandoned, and most of your people do not attend the jumu\\u2019ah or congregational prayer, nor do they pray individually. And most of those amongst you who do pray, pray individually at home, and those who attend congregational prayer are few in number. When one of them attends the prayer, he comes out and finds the people in the markets, abandoning the prayer and immersed in sin, play, immorality, and wrongs, and he does not denounce them. The zak?h is likewise abandoned. It is not taken from the people\\u2019s wealth, nor are their crops counted, nor is the work of Allah\\u2019s Messenger ? in that regard undertaken, nor is the zak?h due on the crops collected, nor spent upon those designated as eligible recipients by Allah from above the seven heavens, as the Prophet ? said, Allah was not pleased with having the recipients of zak?h designated by a prophet or anyone else. Rather, He divided it Himself and took responsibility of designating its recipients with His statement, {Zak?h expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed to collect zak?h and for bringing hearts together for Islam and for freeing captives or slaves and for those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the stranded traveler \\u2013 an obligation imposed by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise} [At-Tawbah: 60].\\u2019 Furthermore, you do not uphold any of the deeds of righteousness in addition to the pillars, nor do you command the people to practice them, whereas all sinful acts are openly committed among you and for most of you they have become part of your nature. This includes committing shirk with Allah, fornication, and sodomy \\u2013 the deed of the people of L?t, the people of the overturned towns about whom Allah said, {And the overturned towns He hurled down, and covered them by that which He covered} [An-Najm: 53-54]. We seek protection with Allah the Mighty, and with His Noble Face, from his wrath and punishment. Likewise usury, sorcery, and claiming to have knowledge of the unseen, and all kinds of sins, including alcohol and other intoxicants, such as tobacco and its likes, prostitution, injustice, aggression, taking the wealth of the poor, the weak, the wealthy, and the farmers \\u2013 you forcibly, aggressively, and unjustly take their wealth \\u2013 and many other similar matters that are too many to count and would take too long to mention, are things that you do not denounce. And whoever claims that he does not commit any of these sins, then as we said earlier, he does not denounce them, nor does he abandon those who commit them. Rather, he supports them with his wealth and his tongue. So even if he doesn\\u2019t commit these sins, he and those who commit them are equal, as Allah ? said, {And it has already been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them until they engage in a talk other than that; otherwise you would be like them} [An-Nis?\\u2019: 140]. And He ? said, {You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those \\u2013 He has decreed within their hearts faith and supported them with a spirit from Him} [Al-Muj?dilah: 22]. And He ? said, {And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire, and you would not have other than Allah any protectors; then you would not be helped} [H?d: 113]. And in the had?th, I have nothing to do with a Muslim living amongst the mushrik?n,\\u2019 and in another had?th, They should not be able to see each other\\u2019s fires.\\u2019 And you are aware of your deeds, and you are aware of the shirk and hideous deeds amongst you, and you know yourselves of this, as He ? said, {Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness, even if he presents his excuses} [Al-Qiy?mah: 14- 15]. He then continued, until he said, And what you mentioned of us killing the kuff?r, then this is a matter that we neither apologize for nor disregard. And we will do more in that regard, insh?\\u2019all?h, and we will advise our children to do likewise after us, and they will advise their children likewise after them, as the Companion said, We will remain upon jih?d, as long as we live.\\u2019 We will rub the noses of the kuff?r in dirt, shed their blood, and take their wealth as ghan?mah by the might and power of Allah. And we do all that in emulation of the Prophet ?, not innovating anything. We do it in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and to come closer to Allah. And we hope to attain abundant rewards by this deed, as per His statement, {Then kill the mushrik?n wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, let them go on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful} [At-Tawbah: 5], and His statement, {And fight them until there is no fitnah and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease \\u2013 then indeed, Allah is seeing of what they do. But if they turn away \\u2013 then know that Allah is your protector. Excellent is the protector, and Excellent is the helper} [Al-Anf?l: 39-40], and His statement, {So when you meet those who disbelieve strike their necks} [Muhammad: 4], and His statement, {Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them} [At-Tawbah: 14]. We desire what is with Allah of abundant rewards, as Allah ? said, {Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed. It is a true promise binding upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur\\u2019?n. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment} [At-Tawbah: 111]. And He ? said, {O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment? It is that you believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you should know. He will forgive for you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence. That is the great attainment. And you will obtain another favor that you love \\u2013 victory from Allah and an imminent conquest; and give good tidings to the believers} [As-Saff: 10-13]. And the other verses and ah?d?th that talk about jih?d and encourage it cannot be counted. And we have no custom other than jih?d, and we have no source of sustenance other than the wealth of the kuff?r. He then continued, until he said, As for having a truce while you are upon other than Islam, then by Allah\\u2019s might and power, this is something impossible. And you know that this is a matter that you\\u2019ve requested from us again and again. You sent us Abdul-Az?z al-Qad?m?, and then you sent us Abdul-Az?z Beg, and you requested from us a truce and offered to pay jizyah in the amount of thirty thousand gold dinars every year, but we did not accept that from you and did not respond to your request for a truce. If you accept Islam, you will enjoy its goodness, and that is what we seek, and if you refuse then we say to you as Allah ? said, {But if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and Allah will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing} [Al-Baqarah: 137]. And we tell you, {Sufficient for us is Allah, and He is the best Disposer of affairs} [?l Imr?n: 173]. And we say, O {Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help} [Al-F?tihah: 4-5]. And we say, {Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, by nature, ever bound to depart} [Al-Isr?\\u2019: 81]. And we say, {The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it]} [Saba\\u2019: 49]. And we say as Allah said to His Prophet, {But if they turn away, say, Sufficient for me is Allah; there is no god except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne} [At-Tawbah: 129]. And as for what you mentioned of a treaty, then know that running away is not an act of men, and we keep ourselves above running away and lying. And we will reach you soon, insh?\\u2019all?h, when Allah brings us to you. So when you hear the cannon strikes and smell the gunpowder, and when you see fire in your lands, insh?\\u2019all?h, then don\\u2019t hold back your strength.

When Al Qaeda took over Al Mukalla in April, it seized government buildings and used trucks to cart off more than $120 million from the central bank \\u2026 But it soon passed control to a civilian council, giving it a budget of more than $4 million to provide services, an arrangement that made sense to local officials seeking to serve their people during wartime. We are not Qaeda stooges,\\u2019 said Abdul-Hakeem bin Mahfood, the council\\u2019s secretary general, in a telephone interview. We formed the council to avoid the destruction of the city.\\u2019 While the council pays salaries and distributes fuel, Al Qaeda maintains a police station to settle disputes, residents said. It has so far made no effort to ban smoking or regulate how women dress. Nor has it called itself Al Qaeda, instead using the name the Sons of Hadhramaut to emphasize its ties to the surrounding province\\u2026 Syria\\u2019s Qaeda affiliate, the Nusra Front, has made itself an essential component of the rebel forces seeking to oust Assad. It recently joined a rebel coalition called the Army of Conquest, putting itself in the same trenches as groups that receive support from the West. They are Muslims, no different from us,\\u2019 said Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the Nusra Front\\u2019s leader, in a recent interview with Al Jazeera. He also said his group had been ordered by Ayman al-Zawahri, Al Qaeda\\u2019s global leader, not to carry out foreign attacks that could disrupt the fight against Assad\\u2026 Civilians living in Nusra Front areas, too, say the group has built local support, refraining from imposing Shariah when residents resisted. Meanwhile, its fighters have distributed food and fixed plumbing systems. In the village of Binnish, it recently fielded a team in a friendly soccer match against another rebel group. Nusra\\u2019s team wore fatigues in line with Islamic modesty, and it lost against players wearing shorts. Nusra are not extremists,\\u2019 said an activist who attended the game... They distribute leaflets at checkpoints and call people to the religion.\\u2019\",\"In light of the policies of the taw?gh?t towards alQ?\\u2019idah in Syria, the author and apostate journalist Ahmed Rashid wrote in New York Review of Books on 15 June 2015 an article clarifying the condition of rapprochement and reconciliation between the t?gh?t regimes and al-Q?\\u2019idah. The title of the article was Why We Need al-Qaeda! Some of what he said was, Could the group long considered the most lethal terrorist organization in the world be the best option left in the Middle East for the US and its allies? \\u2026 [M]embers of the US-led coalition against ISIS, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, are actively supporting al-Nusra with arms and money [indirect support, through opposition joint operations chambers and military, civilian, and local councils, and with the approval and awareness of the aid-providing countries]. \\u2026 [M]uch of the Arab world is now essentially siding with AQAP in a Saudi-led war against Houthi rebels in that country. \\u2026 The truth is that al-Qaeda has evolved in profound ways since the death of Osama bin Laden and the emergence of ISIS. \\u2026 It also has increasingly set itself apart from ISIS in strategy and aims on battlefields in both Syria and Yemen\\u2026 In this war the Arab states openly avoid bombing or attacking al-Nusra and AQAP, and in fact now provide both with financial support and weapons [indirectly, through the factions allied with them]. This is because both groups have now declared aims that are shared by the Arab states. \\u2026 So al-Nusra and AQAP have become allies and not enemies of the Arab states, despite the fact that al-Qaeda itself once sought to overthrow these same regimes\\u2026 [T]he Arabs are justified in concluding that al-Qaeda may be evolving. Both groups have now taken over cities and towns in their respective states \\u2026 And both have set out policies of local control that differ markedly from those of ISIS. Consider al-Nusra, ISIS\\u2019s primary rival in Syria. Unlike ISIS, \\u2026 al-Nusra is cooperating with other anti-Assad groups and recently joined the Army of Conquest alliance of rebel militias in northern Syria. Moreover, in contrast to ISIS\\u2019s largely international and non-Syrian fighting force, al-Nusra\\u2019s fighters are almost wholly Syrian, making them both more reliable and more committed to Syria\\u2019s future. Meanwhile, in interviews with Al Jazeera, al-Nusra leaders have vowed not to attack targets in the West, promoting an ideology that might be called nationalist jihadism\\u2019 rather than global jihad. In recent months, al-Nusra\\u2019s leaders have toned down the implementation of their own brutal version of Islamic law, while putting on hold their own plans of building a caliphate. Many of these same changes have been evident with AQAP in Yemen. \\u2026 The group seized the capital Mukallah, robbed the bank, and then retreated, declining to run the government themselves or impose sharia law and installing a council of elders instead. They have urged the council to focus on governance and providing services to the people\\u2026\",\"Yaroslav Trofimov wrote a similar piece for the Wall Street Journal on 11 June 2015 titled To U.S. Allies, Al Qaeda Affiliate in Syria Becomes the Lesser Evil \\u2013 As Islamic State gains ground, calls to reach out to the Nusra Front intensify. In it he said, In the three-way war ravaging Syria, should the local al Qaeda branch be seen as the lesser evil to be wooed rather than bombed? This is increasingly the view of some of America\\u2019s regional allies and even some Western officials. \\u2026 The three main forces left on the ground [in Syria] today are the Assad regime, Islamic State and an Islamist rebel alliance in which the Nusra Front\\u2014an al Qaeda affiliate designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and the United Nations\\u2014plays a major role. Outnumbered and outgunned, the more secular, Western-backed rebels have found themselves fighting shoulder to shoulder with Nusra in key battlefields. As the Assad regime wobbles and Islamic State, or ISIS, gains ground in both Syria and Iraq, reaching out to the more pragmatic Nusra is the only rational choice left for the international community, supporters of this approach argue\\u2026 At first, it was mostly Turkey and Qatar that aided Syrian Islamist rebels cooperating with Nusra. Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia was more reluctant, wary of abetting al Qaeda [by supporting factions allied with the Jawl?n? front]. \\u2026 In recent months, however, Saudi Arabia\\u2019s new King Salman has moved to work much more closely with Doha and Ankara in supporting the Islamist-dominated rebel alliance that includes Nusra, diplomats and officials in the region say. These countries see the suffering inflicted on Syria by the Assad regime as the main reason for Islamic State\\u2019s emergence in the first place, and they prefer to see Nusra and its allies, rather than Islamic State, move into territory surrendered by Damascus\\u2026 Unlike Islamic State, Nusra is largely composed of Syrians, and its religious views, though certainly radical, aren\\u2019t nearly as extreme. While it has refrained from attacking Israel despite controlling towns along the demarcation line in the Golan Heights, the group has taken on Islamic State and has been willing to work with non-Islamist rebels. Nusra has been a real magnet for young Syrian fighters who don\\u2019t have any particular jihadist or even radical sectarian agenda,\\u2019 said Frederic Hof, who served as President Obama\\u2019s envoy to the Syrian opposition \\u2026 Nusra\\u2019s attempt to differentiate itself from Islamic State was clear in recent interviews that the group\\u2019s leader, Abu Muhammad al Jawlani, gave to Qatar\\u2019s Al Jazeera television network. Dressed in a plaid shirt and his face covered, Mr. Jawlani sat in a high-backed, thronelike chair once occupied by Idlib\\u2019s former governor. He fielded fawning questions during the two separate, nearly hourlong broadcasts, which were widely seen in the region as an effort by Qatar to make Nusra more attractive. While Mr. Jawlani repeated his allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, he said Nusra wasn\\u2019t targeting the West and made conciliatory remarks about the Christian minority\\u2026 [W]ith Islamic State on the offensive, Washington is likely to go pretty far\\u2019 in tolerating the budding collaboration between its regional allies and Nusra, said U.S. Navy Adm. James Stavridis, who retired two years ago as NATO\\u2019s supreme allied commander. It is unlikely we are going to operate side by side with cadres from Nusra, but if our allies are working with them, that is acceptable. If you look back to World War II, we had coalitions with people that we had extreme disagreements with, including Stalin\\u2019s Russia,\\u2019 said Mr. Stavridis \\u2026 I don\\u2019t think that is a showstopper for the U.S. in terms of engaging with that coalition.\\u2019\",\"Allah's Messenger recited, {When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest, and you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes...} [An-Nafr: 1-2. He then said, \\\"Indeed, they will leave it in the multitudes just as they entered into it in multitudes\\\"\",\"Allah's Messenger said, \\\"Indeed, what I fear most for my Ummah are the misguiding imams. And the Hour will not be established until tribes from my Ummah join the mushrikin and until tribes from my Ummah worship idols. And thre will be in my Ummah thirty liars all of whom claim to be prophets. And I am the last of the prophets. There is no prophet after me. And there will always be a party of my Ummah manifest upon the truth not harmed by those who oppose them until there comes the command of Allah\\\"\",\"Abul-Abb?s Ibn Qud?mah ? listed the levels of hisbah (enjoining good and forbidding evil) as: informing the ignorant person, admonishing with kind speech, harshness and cursing (by saying O j?hil or O fool), prevention with force in relation to the tools of the sin not the sinner himself (by pouring out the alcohol, destroying the musical instruments, etc.), and threatening to beat the sinner and actually beating him (which can only be done by those with authority over the sinner). He then said, The son can use from these levels of hisbah: informing [his ignorant parents that such and such is a sin], then gently admonishing and advising them, and from the fourth level of hisbah, he can break their musical instruments, pour their alcohol out, and so on [Mukhtasar Minh?j al-Q?sid?n]. He is not allowed to practice hisbah on them with curses, harshness, threats, or physical beatings\",\"Al-Mard?w? said, D?r al-Harb is where the laws of kufr have the upper hand\",\"His father, Shaykh Abdull?h Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b ? commented upon the fatw? of Shaykhul-Isl?m Ibn Taymiyyah about the Tatars, May Allah ? have mercy upon you, reflect upon the Im?m\\u2019s clarification in this fatw? that the one who forcefully resists a law from the laws of Islam, like the five prayers, fasting, zak?h, or hajj, or forcefully resists abandoning the forbidden matters like fornication, murder, theft and plunder, alcohol, or intoxicants, and so forth, then it is obligatory to fight the party resisting such until the religion is only for Allah alone and until they abide by all laws of Islam, even if they pronounce the shah?dah and hold on to some of the laws of Islam, and that this is something that all the scholars have agreed upon, since the Companions and those after them, and that this is in accordance with the Qur\\u2019?n and the Sunnah. Thus, it becomes clear to you that the mere adherence to Islam coupled with the resistance to some of its laws does not save them from war and that they are to be fought because of their kufr and apostasy from Islam as he made clear in the end of his fatw?\",\"Ash-Sh?fi\\u2019? (rahimahull?h) said, If the ignorant person were excused due to his ignorance, ignorance would be better than knowledge, for ignorance releases him from the burdens of responsibility and relieves his heart of the various punishments. Accordingly, there is no excuse for the slave with regards to his ignorance after the delivery [of the proof] and the ability to access it, {so that mankind will have no argument against Allah after the messengers} [An-Nis?\\u2019: 165]\",\"Ibn Hazm adh-Dh?hir? overemphasized this by saying that whoever permitted the im?mah for a non-Qurash? has denied the had?th of the Prophet ? and disbelieved in Allah. He said, We narrated through Muslim from Abdull?h Ibn Umar that Allah\\u2019s Messenger ? said This matter will remain amongst Quraysh, even if only two of them remained,\\u2019 and through al-Bukh?r? from Mu\\u2019?wiyah who said, I heard Allah\\u2019s Messenger ? say, This matter will remain in Quraysh. No one will oppose them over it but Allah will drag him upon his face into Hell, as long as they uphold the religion.\\u2019\\u2019 I say: The narration of Ibn Umar is more general than the narration of Mu\\u2019?wiyah. Both these narrations \\u2013 although they are in the form of information \\u2013 are authentic and certain. If one were to allow leadership to be in other than Quraysh, it would be denying the report of the Prophet ?. This is kufr in the case of one who allows such. So it is proved that whoever claims leadership and khil?fah from other than Quraysh, is not a khal?fah nor an im?m nor a person of authority. Rather, he has no authority. He, whoever supports him, and whoever approves his authority become sinners and disobedient of Allah by transgressing His limits defined upon the blessed tongue of the Prophet ?\",\"Al-Qalqashand? said, The meaning of bay\\u2019ah is a contract and promise and is very similar to trade in reality [Subh al-A\\u2019sh?].\",\"Im?m Muhammad Ibn Abdil-Wahh?b (rahimahull?h) also said, What you mentioned \\u2026 of your doubt concerning the condition of these taw?gh?t and their followers and whether or not the proof has been established on them, then this is strange! How can you doubt this after I have clarified it to you over and over? The person on whom the proof has not been established is the newcomer to Islam and the person raised in a distant nomadic land, or when the matter is obscure \\u2026 in such a case, takf?r is not made upon him until he is informed of the matter. As for the fundamentals of the religion, which Allah clarified and explicated in His book, then the proof of Allah is the Qur\\u2019?n, so whoever the Qur\\u2019?n reaches has received the proof\",\"On the other hand, the lineage of Shaykh Ab? Bakr al-Badri as-S?marr?\\u2019? al-Baghd?d? not only goes back to Quraysh, but also to the household of the Prophet Muhammad ?. This is famous, well known, and confirmed by the lineage specialists in Iraq and elsewhere. For example, the lineage specialist and author of the book Ash?\\u2019ir al-Ir?q (The Clans of Iraq) said, Alb? Badr? Clan: Their leader [during the era of the author] was Ust?dh Sa\\u2019?d al-Badr?.

Once they realized the truth of Islam they entered it voluntarily, and thus they entered Jannah. So the coercion into captivity and chains was the first cause. It is as if he referred to coercion (into slavery) with the word chains. And because this was behind them entering Jannah, he regarded it as the cause\",\"Many scholars of shar\\u2019? governance have mentioned such appointments in such situations, like alJuwayn? in his prized book Giy?th al-Umam, in which he said, The purpose of im?mah is the betterment of the condition of the general public, planning the affairs, and protecting the frontiers. Therefore, if appointing a single im?m whose orders are executed is possible, then there is no doubt that this is best in accordance with the requisites of governance. If this is not possible, it is not correct to leave and neglect the people whom the im?m\\u2019s supervision does not reach, as there will be no leader to gather them nor any deterrent to prevent them from evil. So they have to appoint ministers to whom they turn for leadership. If they remain leaderless, they will perish, and this is obvious and unpreventable.\",\"It was reported on the authority of Ubayy Ibn Ka\\u2019b who said, No slave leaves off something and does so for the sake of Allah, except that Allah brings him that which is better than it from where he does not expect. And no slave makes light of something or attains it in a manner that is not correct, except that Allah brings him that which is worse than it from where he does not expect\",\"Ibn al-Ath?r said describing the reason it is called bay\\u2019ah, It is as if they all traded their sincere obedience and deepest affairs for what the other side has offered [An-Nih?yah].\",\"Al-Q?sim Ibn Sal?m (rahimahull?h \\u2013 d. 224AH) said, So if they resist zak?h after acknowledging it, offering this with their tongues, having established prayer but only resisted zak?h, that resistance would negate everything before it including their acknowledgement and prayer, just as their refusal to pray before would negate their acknowledgement. What testifies to this is the jih?d of Ab? Bakr as-Sidd?q (radiyall?hu anh) with the Muh?jir?n and Ans?r under his command against the Arab resistance towards zak?h. His jih?d was just like the jih?d of Ras?lull?h (sallall?hu alayhi wa sallam) against the people of shirk, as there was no difference between the two jih?ds with regards to the spilling of blood, the enslaving of families, and the seizing of wealth. And they only resisted zak?h without denying it\",\"Because of these ?th?r and others, when Im?m Ahmad was asked, Is there a (preferred) length of time for rib?t? He answered, Forty days.
